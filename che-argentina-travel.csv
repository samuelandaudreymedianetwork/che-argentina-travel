There are no shortage of things to do in San Carlos de Bariloche, however, I think this is a destination that really shines when you leave the city behind and venture out into nature.

Bariloche is surrounded by crystalline lakes, towering mountains, and lush forests - it is a nature lover's paradise! - and the best way to experience its raw, rugged beauty is by enjoying outdoor adventures.

Some of my favourite memories from Bariloche include horse trekking along the Andes foothills, tackling hiking trails in autumn with the mountainside painted all shades of red and orange, and gazing off at the snow-capped mountains while being the only kayaker on a lake.

There are all sorts of Bariloche day tours to enjoy; you can also raft the white waters of the Manso River, mountain bike to the hamlet of Colonia Suiza, or try to catch some rainbow trout on a fly fishing excursion!

Plus, the nice thing about Bariloche is that it's a destination that can be revisited time and time again as there are always different activities to enjoy with the changing seasons.

So with this in mind, we're sharing a few different Bariloche day trips you may want to consider ranging from light adventures to thrill-seeking activities.

Best Bariloche Day Tours 

1. Horse Trekking and BBQ Lunch 

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 6 hours | ✅ Book it!

One of our favourite types of tours to book when we travel in Argentina are horse trekking excursions. This is something we've done all over the country from the Sierras down to Patagonia and the experiences have ranged from one-day treks to overnight adventures.

During our most recent visit to Bariloche, we booked a horseback riding excursion and it proved to be a great way to explore the foothills of the Andes. 

This particular tour kicks off at one of the oldest working ranches in the area and it includes a two-hour horse trek riding past lakes and forests before reaching the Patagonian steppe.

Over the course of the ride, you'll be led by gauchos and the horses are very tame, so it's an experience you can enjoy even as a beginner rider.

Afterwards, you return to the ranch for a 3-course meal featuring a traditional Argentine BBQ with free-flowing wine. This is a quintessential Argentine experience that you need to experience at least once during your visit!

""This was such an incredible excursion. If you’re contemplating booking this, just do it! The guides and hosts were all so incredible. The place itself was absolutely magical. The horses were all so sweet and calm. It was an amazing way to see the mountains and the landscape, paired with some delicious breakfast and authentic asado."" -Madeline

2. Hike in the Andes Mountains

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 7 hours | ✅ Book it!

Bariloche is a lakeside city surrounded by mountains and that means plenty of hiking opportunities. Even after three trips to the city, I have yet to repeat a single hike because there are so many to choose from!

I think one of the best Bariloche day tours you can go on is this customizable full-day hiking trip in the Andes Mountains. What I like about this particular excursion is that it can be tailored to your interests and level of fitness.

This is also a private tour so it's just you and your party plus your local guide, which gives you even more flexibility.

This hiking tour includes snacks, beverages and a boxed lunch. Trekking poles and gaiters are provided if needed. 

I've done a lot of independent hiking in Bariloche, but one of my favourite experiences was a guided hike up to Laguna Verde via Refugio Neumeyer. It's not a trek I would have chosen on my own, so I'm glad I joined a tour. 

I did this hike in autumn together with my husband and the colours were simply spectacular! But you can enjoy Bariloche any time of year.

You can view some of the best Bariloche hikes on All Trails to get an idea of what's available. You can always request a particular hike if there's one you're keen to do. 

Once you're back in town from your hike, you can always treat yourself to a cold beer at one of Bariloche's many craft breweries.

""Juan Carlo was an AMAZING guide - very knowledgeable about everything we saw, and eager to answer all our questions, not just about what we were seeing but about Patagonia and Argentine culture and politics. And mate!"" -Harvey

3. Explore the Seven Lakes Route

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 12 hours | ✅ Book it!

The Seven Lakes Route is one of the more popular day tours you can do from Bariloche.

Known locally as La Ruta de los Siete Lagos, this 107-kilometre drive stretches between the towns of San Martín de los Andes and Villa La Angostura, with many tours departing from Bariloche.

The route crosses two national parks, Lanín National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park, and offers beautiful scenery. 

Along the way, you journey past snow-capped mountains, thick forests and, of course, the seven lakes that give this route its name.

This is a bus tour that stops at various scenic points along the way; you'll visit all the lakes, plus a waterfall, and have free time to explore the town of San Martin de los Andes.

If you want to do this trip at your own pace and you feel confident driving in Argentina, you can rent a car and do this day tour independently.

""What an amazing trip with views that will take your breath away. It was a long day but the bus was comfortable and the guide and driver were very kind and accommodating."" -Melissa

4. Kayak Lago Moreno

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

We've gotten to do some kayaking during our trips to Bariloche and it's always a fun way to take in the sights and enjoy some time out in nature. 

When it comes to kayaking in Bariloche, Lago Moreno is a popular spot. This is a glacial lake that's divided into two sections: Moreno East and Moreno West. What sets it apart is that its waters are much warmer than other lakes in the area and much calmer than neighbouring Lake Nahuel Huapi.

The nice thing about this tour is that you also get to drive part of Bariloche's Circuito Chico, a route that winds past mountains, lakes and scenic lookout points.

The tour kicks off from Arroyo Angostura and over the course of the day, you get to see sights like Cerro Lopez, Cerro Bella Vista, and Cerro Llao Llao which is home to the iconic Llao Llao Hotel.

You can book this Bariloche day tour as a morning or afternoon excursion. 

""Excellent experience and the highlight of our Bariloche trip overall! The kayaking route is gorgeous, with seemingly new views around every corner, and no other tourists in sight. The guides are outstanding and great conversationalists… we could have spent all day with Andy! Finally, lots of bonus features on this one. The route to and from the journey also takes you around the Circuito Chico sightseeing route, so you get to enjoy that tour as well. In addition, we had local snacks and a yerba mate experience while resting at the halfway point of our kayak trip. Basically a bunch of the Bariloche highlights all rolled into one!"" -Scott

5. Raft the Manso River

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10 hours | ✅ Book it!

If you're looking for some thrills during your visit to Bariloche, you can always go white water rafting!

On this particular adventure tour, you travel down Route 40 and then begin heading west towards the border with Chile.

You then reach a ranch on the shores of the Manso River for some coffee and a safety chat about what to expect over the course of the rafting journey. 

Sections of the Manso River have names like Scream and Turn Left, the Slide, Deep Throat, Ecstasy, and Scrambled Egg so that's a little foreshadowing of what you'll encounter. 

This rafting tour is a seasonal activity that runs from November to April. The physical requirement for this activity is moderate to high. 

""We got picked up in Bariloche and had a rather long drive to a camp near the raft launch. When we arrived, they served us coffee, tea, and some breads while we waited for everyone to congregate. Then we got suited up and piled back into the vans to get to the launch point. At the river, we were divided up by language and put into rafts. Then we got a good rundown of how to paddle and sit in the boat. The ride was super fun and beautiful! There were even a few opportunities to jump off the raft and swim in some calmer parts of the river! Once the boating was done, we changed back into our clothes and drove back to the camp for lunch. I would recommend bringing a towel to help dry off before changing. You had to pay extra for lunch, but it was reasonably priced and pretty good. There was also the option to buy photos of your trip for an additional fee. After lunch we got back in the vans for the drive back to Bariloche."" -Nicole

6. Go Fly Fishing

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10 hours | ✅ Book it!

If you've ever wanted to try fly fishing, Patagonia would be the place to do so!

When it comes to Bariloche day tours, this activity is a big ticket item but it's also a private tour and a customizable experience. You can even book multi-day fly fishing tours that combine riverside glamping and days spent on drift boats.

On this particular day excursion, you'll sail the waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake on a private charter boat. You'll spend the day on the water, where depending on your experience level, you'll either learn the basics of fly fishing or perfect your skills fishing for wild rainbow trout and brown trout. 

Aside from spending the day fishing, you'll also enjoy a riverside lunch featuring Argentinean steak and Malbec wine - a match made in heaven!

The nice thing about this fly fishing tour is that all the gear is provided, so you don't have to bring all your gear if you don't want to. 

You'll be provided with Orvis waders and boots, Orvis lines and reels, BVK temple fork rods, a dry bag, local flies and whatever else is needed. 

This is also one of the highest rated tours in Bariloche with rave reviews, so you know you're in good hands.

We've had the opportunity to go fly fishing at some Patagonian estancias (Estancia Tecka is one of our favourites!) and even though we had zero experience we managed to have a really fun time! By our second day, we were already catching multiple rainbow trout.

""Don't tell anyone about Trout Bariloche's base camp fishing trip! My three friends and I floated on Rio Manso and waded in Rio Foyel and never saw another angler. In fact, the ONLY other person we saw was one of the Trout Bariloche guides in a raft doing some scouting on the Manso. Even when we floated the popular Rio Limay, we only saw two other drift boats. Meanwhile we caught lots of rainbows (I caught my personal best rainbow) and some browns while enjoying stunning scenery, some of the most beautiful river water we've ever seen, great food, and comfortable platform tents. The guides were not only helpful, they were excellent coaches, and tour guides. I do not hesitate to recommend Trout Bariloche and I would look forward to going back again. Thank you to Emanuel, Juanito, Lukas, Mendo, Tomas, and ""Juan Cinco"". -Tom

7. Mountain Bike to Colonia Suiza

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3-4 hours | ✅ Book it!

Another option for an active Bariloche day tour is to go mountain biking! 

This particular tour kicks off in Lago Gutierrez and from there, you ride 18 kilometres to the hamlet of Colonia Suiza. You get to cycle part of Bariloche's famous Circuito Chico.

This is a nice way to soak in the natural scenery as the route weaves through the forest, across rivers, past lakes and waterfalls with plenty of stops at scenic viewpoints along the way.

This is considered an easy bike tour with an elevation gain of 100 meters. It takes about 3-4 hours to complete depending on the group's pace. You will travel along trails and roads with very little or no traffic.

""We took a bike ride from Gutiérrez to Colonia Suiza. Very fun! Great guides!! The bicycles are like new, 10."" -A Tripadvisor Reviewer

🤩 Check Prices and Availability!

8. Tour the Circuito Chico

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 hours | ✅ Book it!

Circuito Chico is perhaps the most popular half-day tour from Bariloche! 

Located just west of the city, Circuito Chico is a picturesque 27-kilometre loop that winds past mountains, rivers and lakes with multiple panoramic lookouts along the way.

This is a trip that be done by joining a guided tour, or independently by renting a car, hiring some bikes or hopping on the local bus. 

During this Circuito Chico tour, you'll make a stop at Cerro Campanario. This is a mountain that offers panoramic views of Bariloche and the surrounding lakes and mountain peaks. 

Riding the chairlift to the top is an additional cost not included in the tour, however, it's worth going up as this is one of the main stops along the route. Also, the viewpoint from Cerro Campanario was voted by National Geographic as one of the top 10 panoramic views in the world.

The tour then continues towards the Llao Llao Peninsula where you can see the Llao Llao Hotel up on the hill and Parroquia San Eduardo, a hilltop chapel made of timber and stone that dates back to 1938.

Could you spend longer than 3 hours exploring Bariloche's Circuito Chico? Absolutely. 

If you do this trip independently, you can take your time stopping at restaurants and breweries along the way and even tackle some of the side trails. However, if you're pressed for time and want to see Circuito Chico in half a day, this tour does exactly that.

""Classic tour of Barilloche. The highlight is a chairlift to the peak of one of the mountains surrounding the Argentina-Chilean lake district. The views are among the most spectacular anywhere in the world. A dozen lakes stretch out around the peak. They are deep blue, green, battleship grey depending on the distance and the cloud cover. Other lookout points follow. Overall, a short but excellent tour. The guides are very professional, very helpful, and very keen to explain the nature and history of what you are seeing. Highly recommended."" -Thomas

9. Visit Cerro Tronador and Black Glacier

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 9 hours | ✅ Book it!

Another Bariloche tour that offers epic landscapes is the day trip to Cerro Tronador and the Black Glacier.

Cerro Tronador is the highest mountain in the area standing 3,478 meters above sea level and it also forms part of the natural boundary between Argentina and Chile. Its name translates to Thunder Mountain due to the loud thundering roar it produces when chunks of ice and snow break off. 

Meanwhile, the Black Glacier, locally known as Ventisquero Negro, is one of fourteen glaciers found on Cerro Tronador. The glacier gets its name due to the sediments which give it a dark colour, setting it apart from other glaciers in Patagonia - like Perito Moreno in El Calafate - which are white and light blue. 

This full-day excursion will take you down rugged roads and past forests, lakes, valleys and rivers, so it's a great way to soak in the natural beauty of northern Patagonia.

""This tour was incredible. The scenery speaks for itself, but even more I recommend this tour because the tour guide Martin was awesome. He gave loads of background information about the area, spoke fluent Spanish and English and translate every detail even though I was the only English speaking person. I highly recommend this tour."" -Lena

10. Explore the Arrayanes Forest and Victoria Island

⭐️ RATING: 4/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 6-7 hours | ✅ Book it!

Visiting the Arrayanes Forest and Victoria Island is another one of those classic day trips from Bariloche. 

This boat tour departs from Puerto Pañuelo and you then begin sailing towards the Quetrihue Peninsula to visit the famous Arrayanes Forest. This forest is home to the arrayán tree and what's unique about the tree is that it always feels cool to the touch; this is because its bark is so thin that you can feel the sap flowing inside!

The trees in the Arrayanes Forest are around 300 years old, though you can also find a few specimens over 650 years old. There's an 800-metre boardwalk that winds its way through the forest and it takes about 30 minutes to complete.

After visiting the forest, you'll board the catamaran once more and sail towards Puerto Anchorena on Victoria Island or Isla Victoria. Once you reach the island, you'll have the opportunity to go on a guided hike or explore on your own. 

We decided to hang out at the local beach with turquoise waters, Playa del Toro, and then we embarked on our own hike. If you do decide to explore solo, just make sure you're back at the dock on time for the journey back.

You can organize this trip independently (which is what we did) by making your own way to Puerto Pañuelo (we took the local bus) and then booking your catamaran ticket at the port. You can read all about our day trip to Victoria Island and the Arrayanes Forest here.

Tip: you can also visit the Arrayanes Forest from Villa La Angostura. We did this as another day trip where we hopped on a boat tour to reach the forest and then hiked back to town via the peninsula.

""A nice experience. Plenty of time taking in the stunning views on the lakes, an enjoyable hike and some pleasant driving. No hesitation is recommending this to other."" -Ainsley

You can even join guided bus tours to explore Circuito Chico, the Route of the Seven Lakes, or Cerro Tronador and the Black Glacier.

Whatever your travel style, there's something out there for you. Hopefully, this list has helped you narrow down the options.

This mountain town sits on the edge of Lake Lácar and is surrounded by forested mountains in all directions, meaning it's a great place to enjoy outdoor activities - hiking, biking, kayaking, water rafting you name it!

San Martin de Los Andes is also the gateway to Lanín National Park, which is home to an extinct volcano, lakes galore, and an abundance of wildlife.

This is a popular stop on the itinerary for anyone travelling across Northern Patagonia for good reason, so we're going to show you what you can get up to.

Things to do in San Martin de Los Andes

Go on a Boat Trip of Lake Lácar

The main thing to do in San Martin de Los Andes is to go on a boat tour of Lake Lácar because that's how you'll hit up several of the attractions in the area.

Tours depart from the Lake Lácar waterfront in the west end of town and cruise across the 25-kilometre lake making multiple stops along the way.

This full-day boat tour of Lake Lacar includes stops in Quila Quina, Hua Hum and Santa Teresita Island, so you're seeing all the highlights!

Quila Quina Beach

The first stop on the boat tour is Quila Quina Beach. The boat is your best option for reaching this beach as the alternative is a very winding 18-kilometre drive on unpaved roads.

A lot of people like to pack a picnic, catch the earliest boat, and spend the day enjoying the beach before grabbing the last boat back to town.

Since we opted to do the complete boat tour, our time in Quila Quina was brief, but we had enough time to grab lunch by the pier and go on a short hike in the area before hopping back on the boat to continue the journey.

Chachin Waterfall

Next, we travelled westwards until we reached the end of Lake Lácar and crossed a very narrow and shallow opening that connects it to Lake Nonthue.

Here we disembarked and went on a hike through the Valdivian forest in search of the Chachin Waterfall.

The trail isn't very long; 2.1 kilometres round trip and it takes about 45 minutes to complete.

At the end, we were rewarded with a beautiful forest waterfall with an emerald pool at its base.

Hua Hum

After hiking back down from the waterfall, we got back on the boat and continued to Hua Hum.

Hua Hum is the Argentina-Chile border pass and it's the lowest pass over the mountain range at about 640 meters above sea level.

Since we weren't hiking across the border, we stopped at Hostería Hua Hum to enjoy an afternoon snack. They have an onsite tea house that serves all sorts of cakes and pastries.

We again had a bit of free time to enjoy a wander along the lake and soak in the scenery, before boarding the boat again for our final stop.

Santa Teresita Island

Our final stop was the Island of Santa Teresita, which is home to a small chapel by the same name.

This small wooden chapel is where the early pioneers used to come to celebrate their weddings.

It was a short hike from the pier through a forest of Arrayan trees - similar to Bosque de Arrayanes in Villa La Angostura though on a much smaller scale and with younger trees.

And that concluded our boat trip of Lake Lácar. As you can see, we covered a lot of attractions in one day!

These are places you can reach by car if you're willing to drive on some rather rugged roads, but the boat trip is so pleasant and it makes the sightseeing so easy, that I really would recommend this option above others.

Drive the Road of the Seven Lakes

San Martin de Los Andes is the starting or ending point of the Road of the Seven Lakes, depending on which way you drive it.

This 107-kilometre drive stretches between the towns of San Martin de Los Andes and Villa La Angostura and is considered one of the most scenic drives in all of Argentina.

The route crosses two national parks, Lanín National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park. Plus, as the name suggests, it also goes past seven lakes which include: Lake Machónico, Lake Escondido, Lake Correntoso, Lake Espejo, Lake Lácar, Lake Falkner, and Lake Villarino.

But that's not all, along the drive there are panoramic viewpoints, waterfalls, hikes, and mountains! So even though the distance isn't quite that long, it can turn into a full day activity of leisurely driving and making stops along the way.

The Road of the Seven Lakes is something that can be done independently if you feel comfortable renting a car in Argentina, or you can join a full-day tour that includes transportation and a local guide. We opted for the latter.

This particular tour departs from San Martin de Los Andes and brings you back at the end of the day.

Shop at the Artisanal Fair

San Martin de Los Andes is well known for its artisanal fair, Feria de los Artesanos, which takes place on the west side of Plaza San Martin.

This is a great place to stock up on some Patagonian souvenirs like a mate and bombilla (the gourd and metal straw used for drinking mate).

You can also buy knives used for cutting meat at an asado (traditional Argentine BBQ).

Plus, there are all sorts of leather goods, hand-knitted items, artisanal chocolates, honey and jams, and so much more.

The fair's hours of operation really vary throughout the year, but if you happen to visit in the summertime during high season, the artisanal fair takes place daily from 6:00 pm -11:00 pm.

Hike the Trails Around Town

One of the main things to do in San Martin de Los Andes is to hike the trails in and around town.

Because the town sits in a valley in between two mountain ranges, the hiking opportunities are endless.

Some of the easier hikes departing from the town include:

Mirador Arrayán: lake and town views from the south side, plus it leads to a tea house will tell you all about it in the food section! (2.6 kms, 30 mins)

Mirador Bandurrias: moderate hike offering views of Lake Lácar (4.0 kms, 1 h 30 mins)

You can view more trails in and around San Martin de Los Andes here.

Visit Lanín National Park

Lanín National Park is located 66 kilometres north of San Martin de Los Andes and it's a 1 hour and 12 minute drive.

It was founded in 1937 and is the third-largest national park in Argentina boasting Patagonian forests, Patagonian steppe, and the high Andes mountain range.

As for wildlife, Lanín National Park is home to pumas, foxes, condors, and monito del monte - the only native marsupial present in all of Argentina and Chile.

However, the park is perhaps best known for being home to the Lanín Volcano which rises 3,776 meters above sea level.

The cone-shaped volcano actually straddles the Argentine-Chilean border and therefore forms part of two national parks, Lanín in Argentina and Villarrica in Chile.

If you are not an avid hiker, you can visit the park as part of a day trip from San Martin de Los Andes.

This tour goes through Junin de los Andes, stops at Lago Huechulafquen which is an emerald glacial lake, visits Lanín Volcano from the southern base, takes you to the Mapuche community of Cañicul, and also tours Lago Paimun before returning to town.

If you are an avid hiker, you may want to check out some of the various hiking trails in Lanín National Park. Note that climbing the volcano is a multi-day route that does require some training!

Sample the Artisanal Chocolates

For anyone with a sweet tooth, another thing to do in San Martin de Los Andes is to sample the artisanal chocolates.

And you really won't have any trouble finding them because there are chocolate shops all along the main street, sometimes several per block and even across from each other.

A few to get you started include:

Pasta Negra Chocolates

The Old Village

Artesanales Familia Greco

Regionales Antulauquen

Mamusia

What kind of chocolate flavours can you expect to find?

There's milk chocolate, sea salt and caramel, coffee, almonds, walnuts, grated coconut, raisins and dried fruits, cashews, cocoa nibs and so much more!

These also make a great souvenir to take back home with you, so grab a few for family and friends.

Eating in San Martin de Los Andes

We sure worked up an appetite in between all the hiking and sightseeing, so we tried plenty of restaurants along the way.

Here are a few of the places we enjoyed:

Tío Paco

For a classic, hearty Argentine meal, we ate at Tío Paco.

Here we ordered the bife de chorizo a lo pobre, which is the 'Striploin steak poor style'. Now there is nothing poor or lean about this meal. You basically have a nice, big juicy steak topped with caramelized onions and a fried egg, plus a side of potatoes. Talk about a filling meal.

We also ordered the ravioli stuffed with ricotta served in a cream sauce with chicken, ham and walnuts. It was delicious!

We paired the meal with a bottle of Malbec wine - an Argentine staple a the dinner table.

And for dessert, we got cheesecake with forest berries and a cup of coffee. Did we need it? No. Did we enjoy it? Yes.

Zen Tea

If you've consumed your fill of parrilla, pizza and pasta and you're craving some lighter dishes and perhaps even healthier meals, Zen Tea is the place to go.

Don't let the name confuse you - this isn't a tea house!

Zen Tea offers a wide variety of health-conscious dishes, but what surprised me most was that everything was delicious, innovative and bursting with flavour.

Before our mains even came out, the restaurant served us complimentary breadsticks with a carrot dip, curry powder and sesame seeds. That was followed by a hot potato-ginger-onion soup served in shot glasses. Again, they fed us all of this before we even got our meal!

Next came the barley bowl with shrimp in a soy-based sauce with grilled zucchini and eggplant, plus shredded red cabbage on top. It was everything I had been missing. 

We also tried their hot wrap with salmon, cream cheese and pumpkin, which came with a side of roasted potatoes. 

Who knew eating at a healthy restaurant could be so tasty? But seriously, if you've been travelling in Argentina for a while and you're craving a change from the local diet, this is a nice place to consider.

Casa de Té Arrayan

Visiting the Arrayan Tea House is an experience in and of itself.

For starters, it's a nice walk up from town which offers various vantage points along the way. Once you reach the top, you are rewarded with views of Lake Lácar and the town of San Martin de Los Andes below.

Here we enjoyed a three-tiered tea featuring sandwiches, scones, cakes, muffins, and more.

This is a place where you'll want to come hungry because the portions are quite generous.

If you can't finish it all, fret not because they will pack it up for you.

Helados Mamusia

Mamusia makes artisanal ice cream and chocolates, and while they have a shop in town, we got dessert from their food truck which parks by the lake's edge. The perfect place to enjoy a sweet treat.

We got a tub of ice cream to share and chose three different flavours: dulce de leche, Bailey's ice cream, and strawberry with chocolate (there were real chunks of strawberry in there!)

Staying in San Martin de Los Andes

When it comes to accommodations, San Martin de Los Andes offers a nice mix of cottages, self-catering apartments and lodges.

Here are a few to consider:

Del Sauco Apart & Spa - alpine-style accommodations overlooking the mountains featuring a heated pool

Cabañas del Lacar - lakeside apartments with a cosy log cabin feel in the centre of town

Cabañas Las Pampas - self-catering cottages with wood interiors offering 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms",CheArgentinaTravel.com,4aa4979afe7e584a5d9a66d8c77c6d9c955c4b4c

Nestled at the southernmost tip of Argentina, Ushuaia is nicknamed the City at the End of the World and beckons adventurous travellers to its remote corners. This city is not just a gateway to Antarctica but also a portal to some of the most breathtaking landscapes on Earth and some unmissable adventures!

Yes, getting to Ushuaia takes some effort but the rewards are high. From the pristine waters of the Beagle Channel to the rugged trails of the Fuegian Andes Mountains and the mystical wonders of the Vinciguerra Glacier, Ushuaia offers an array of epic tours that promise unparalleled experiences.

Whether you're a thrill-seeker, nature lover, or simply a curious traveller, Ushuaia's tours are bound to etch memories that last a lifetime.

So without further ado, here are 10 handpicked Ushuaia tours for you to consider on your trip!

10 Epic Ushuaia Tours You Can't Miss!

1. Cruise the Beagle Channel

At the top of the list is a boat tour of the Beagle Channel!

The Beagle Channel is the strait in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago that links the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.

The channel is named after the British ship HMS Beagle, in which Charles Darwin explored the area between 1833 and 1834.

There are many ways to experience the Beagle Channel from sailing boats to catamarans to yachts! However, all outings focus on viewing wildlife and seeing the iconic Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse.

The Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse is often mistaken as the 'Lighthouse at the End of the World'. However, that distinction belongs to the San Juan de Salvamento Lighthouse, which is located on the east coast of the rather remote Isla de los Estados and was made famous by Jules Verne’s novel The Lighthouse at the End of the World.

This particular Beagle Channel boat tour includes a stop in Isla Bridges, where passengers disembark and go on a mini trek to observe the local flora and fauna, and learn the history of the native Yámanas who once called this place home.

Book your Beagle Channel boat tour here.

2. Visit Estancia Harberton

Estancia Harberton is the southernmost estancia or ranch in the world, and that alone makes it a must-visit attraction in Tierra del Fuego!

Estancia Harberton is located about 85 kilometres from Ushuaia, with most of the journey being on a gravel road. It can be accessed by car or as part of guided tours that depart from Ushuaia.

The estancia was founded in 1886 by Reverend Thomas Bridges, an English missionary who worked with the indigenous Yámana people and who was also the author of the dictionary of the Yámana or Yaghan language.

The Argentine government granted him this land in appreciation of his services, and the estancia was named Harberton after the home of Bridges' wife, Mary, in Devon, England.

The original homestead and many of the surrounding buildings are still standing, built in a distinctive British architectural style but with adaptations suited to the harsh Fuegian climate.

The ranch covers about 50,000 acres, predominantly sheep-grazing land interspersed with patches of native forests and bordered by the Beagle Channel.

While it's still a working ranch, Estancia Harberton has expanded its operations to include tourism. Visitors can tour the historical buildings, explore the natural surroundings, and get a glimpse of life on a Patagonian ranch. The ranch also serves as a base for various excursions in the region, including boat trips on the Beagle Channel.

Within the estancia's grounds is the Acatushún Museum, which focuses on marine mammals and birds. It's particularly known for its collection of marine mammal skeletons.

Admittedly, this is one of the pricier Ushuaia tours you can book, but it does include a cruise on the Beagle Channel, you get to see Imperial Cormorants on Isla de los Pájaros, sea lions on Isla de los Lobos, and you disembark and walk among penguins on Martillo Island (something that other day tours cannot do).

Book your tour to Estancia Harberton.

3. Emerald Lagoon Trekking

The Emerald Lagoon, locally known as Laguna Esmeralda, is located approximately 20 kilometres northeast of Ushuaia, nestled in the valleys of the Fuegian Andes.

The Emerald Lagoon's standout feature is its intense green-turquoise colour, which contrasts starkly with the surrounding snow-capped mountains and dense green forests. The lagoon's colour is a result of the glacial and rainwater it receives.

The primary way to experience the lagoon is through a hiking trail that leads visitors to its shores. The trek spans roughly 9 kilometres in total and can take 3 to 4 hours round trip depending on the pace of the group, photo ops along the way, terrain conditions and weather.

The trail takes hikers through diverse landscapes including forests, peat bogs, and small streams, offering a rich and immersive natural experience. Along the way to the lagoon, hikers can witness a variety of local plant species, including lenga and coihue trees.

The area is also home to several species of birds and occasionally offers sightings of local wildlife such as foxes.

Being in Tierra del Fuego at the end of the world means the weather can be unpredictable even during the warmer months. It's not uncommon to experience shifts in weather, including rain and snow, during a single day's hike. For this reason, preparation and dressing in layers is key.

Once you reach the shores of Laguna Esmeralda, you get to enjoy a box lunch picnic and soak in the views before returning to Ushuaia.

4. End of the World Train & National Park Visit

All aboard!

Another must-do tour in Ushuaia - especially for any train enthusiasts out there! - is to ride the Southern Fuegian Railway, better known as the End of the World Train.

This now famous Ushuaia train was originally built in the early 20th century to serve the Ushuaia prison, which housed some of Argentina's most hardened criminals.

The prisoners were responsible for constructing their own prison and had to use the railway to transport timber from the forests to the prison, where it was used for heating and building purposes.

Today the former prisoners' train is a popular tourist attraction. The route starts at the ""End of the World"" train station, travelling through the Pipo River Valley, the Macarena waterfall area, the Tree Cemetery, and ending in the Tierra del Fuego National Park. The entire journey is set against a backdrop of the pristine Fuegian forest, snow-capped mountains, and vibrant peat bogs.

What's nice about this particular tour is that it combines the End of the World train ride with a guided visit to Tierra del Fuego National Park.

You'll get to visit Bahía Ensenada Zaratiegui, which is the bay where you'll find the famed End of the World Post Office. Here you'll have the opportunity to send a postcard and get your passport stamped.

Next, you'll continue to Bahía Lapataia where you can find the End of the World sign, which symbolizes the end of the Pan-American Route which links Ushuaia with Alaska. Plus, you'll also get to see Laguna Verde and Lago Roca.

If you're pressed for time in Ushuaia or maybe you don't want to spend any time hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park, this tour offers a great overview and takes you to the most important spots in the park.

Book your End of the World train and park visit here.

5. 4x4 Off-Road Adventure

If you’re looking for an adrenaline-filled day, then consider this 4x4 off-road tour!

This tour departs from Ushuaia and is a great opportunity to experience the ruggedness of Tierra del Fuego’s landscapes.

Over the course of the day, you’ll cross the southern Andes Mountain Range. You’ll see Lago Escondido, which means 'hidden lake' and is situated at the bottom of a deep valley. Plus, you’ll experience Lago Fagnano, the largest lake in Tierra del Fuego, which is shared by both Argentina and Chile and is known as Lago Cami on the Chilean side.

You’ll venture off-road and drive through rugged terrain, weave your way through the forest, tackle river crossings, and follow trails that hug the coastline.

Things will get muddy and a little bumpy, but it’ll be an adventure to remember.

But that’s not all, because this is Argentina, you’ll get to enjoy a traditional Fuegian asado or barbecue, paired with a bottle of Malbec - the national grape!

6. Ushuaia Helicopter Tour

How does a scenic helicopter flight over the southernmost city in the world sound?

This is one of the most epic tours you can do in Ushuaia and hands down one that you won’t soon forget!

Ushuaia is surrounded by majestic landscapes. You have glaciers, islands, forests, bays, and mountains - after all, this is where the Andes Mountains end!

Maybe you got a sneak peek on your flight into the city, but if you want a complete aerial view, then you can’t go wrong with a Ushuaia helicopter tour.

And thankfully, there are 3 different options ranging in price and flight time:

Ushuaia Scenic Tour (7 min): This flight will give you an overview of Ushuaia, plus you’ll get to see Golondrina Bay, Susana Mount, Martial Glacier, the Museum of the Prison of Ushuaia, Ushuaia Port Harbour and Ushuaia Bay.

Emerald Lagoon (15 min): This flight will take you over Ushuaia, plus you’ll also get to see Olivia Mountain. From there, you’ll continue towards Cinco Hermanos Mount, the peatlands of the Carbajal Valley, Tierra Mayor Valley, the Emerald Lagoon, and you’ll end the tour over Ushuaia Bay.

Landing at the Andes (30 min): This tour has the longest flight time and you get to see quite a bit! You’ll fly over Ushuaia and continue east towards Olivia Mountain which stands 4,350 feet high. You'll get to see the peatlands of the Carbajal Valley and then reach the Emerald Lagoon. The helicopter will then land in a stop area, where you'll get to enjoy the imposing mountain views of the Andes Mountain Range. You’ll then toast this once-in-a-lifetime bucket list adventure with a glass of champagne atop the mountain.

7. Vinciguerra Glacier Trek

If you didn’t get your fill of glaciers in El Calafate, then a trek to the Vinciguerra Glacier on the outskirts of Ushuaia is something to add to the list!

Vinciguerra Glacier is located approximately 20 kilometres northwest of Ushuaia amidst the Andes Mountains.

The primary way to experience this glacier is through a moderately challenging hike that takes visitors up to its base. The trek typically takes 4 to 6 hours round trip, depending on the weather conditions and the hiking pace.

Along the way, the trail to Vinciguerra Glacier passes through dense forests, peat bogs, and rocky terrains, offering a diverse landscape.

Positioned at the base of the Vinciguerra Glacier is the Tempanos Lagoon. This glacial lagoon is dotted with floating icebergs that have broken off from the glacier above creating a beautiful panorama for visitors.

While the Vinciguerra Glacier is accessible year-round, the optimal time for a visit is during the Southern Hemisphere's summer months, so from December to March. During this period, the weather is relatively milder, and the paths are less treacherous.

Note: this is a trek TO the glacier and not ON the glacier! You will NOT be wearing crampons and trekking on the glacier.

Book your trek to Vinciguerra Glacier here.

8. Trekking and Canoeing in Lapataia Bay

For a fun and active visit to Tierra del Fuego National Park, consider this Ushuaia tour that combines a day of trekking and canoeing.

During this tour, you'll go on a 7-kilometre hike through the Sub-antarctic forest dropping into the shores of the Beagle Channel. This hike is considered medium difficulty.

Upon completing the hike, you'll enjoy lunch on the shores of Lago Roca / Lago Acegami in a geodesic dome.

Afterwards, you'll be provided with rubber boots, waterproof pants, and life jackets before hopping aboard an inflatable canoe. You'll then paddle the Lapataia River until you reach Lapataia Bay, which should take about 1 hour.

Book your trek and canoe tour in Lapataia Bay here.

9. Double Decker Bus City Tour

The Ushuaia double-decker bus tour is a 1-hour sightseeing tour that does a loop around the city hitting up some of the major attractions along the way.

Picture a bright blue, old-fashioned double-decker bus that will transport you back in time as soon as you step aboard. Over the course of the tour, you’ll get to learn about Ushuaia’s history and hear fun anecdotes, with a bit of tango music in between. The commentary is done in Spanish and/or English depending on the group, plus they also have narrated audio in 7 languages.

The bus tour goes past landmarks like the old prison, the city port, and offers views of downtown Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel along the way.

The bus makes two stops during the tour, one at the Devil's Lagoon in the city's west end, and the other at the Ushuaia Aeroclub which offers panoramic views of downtown Ushuaia. The bus does not make any other stops, so the tour is geared at providing an overview of the city more than anything else.

Note: this is NOT a hop-on hop-off tour even if it is sometimes labelled as such. There will be a couple of brief stops along the way for photos, however, you can't get off of the bus and wait for the next one like on a traditional hop-on hop-off tour. 

Book your Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour here.

10. Cerro Castor

If you're planning to visit Ushuaia in winter and enjoy skiing or snowboarding, then you can enjoy an action-packed day at Cerro Castor.

This ski lodge is located 26 kilometres from Ushuaia and is a popular winter day trip to hit the slopes.

Cerro Castor has the distinction of being the southernmost ski resort in the world. It is also the only ski centre in Argentina that has an ice rink at its base.

The views from Cerro Castor are unparalleled. Skiers and snowboarders can enjoy impressive views of the Beagle Channel and the surrounding forests of Tierra del Fuego.

Plus, beyond skiing and snowboarding, visitors can also enjoy a range of winter activities like snowshoeing, sled rides, and off-piste skiing.

Snow Bar

Ona House

Morada del Águila

Alpino Sports Bar

Restaurante 480

All this to say, you won't go cold and you won't go hungry on the slopes of Cerro Castor.

Book your ski/snowboard pass for Cerro Castor.

Tips for enjoying your Ushuaia day tours

If you're visiting Ushuaia for just a few days during high season, be sure to book your excursions in advance, especially if you want to do a particular activity that's only offered a few times a week. You wouldn't want to come all this way for it to be fully booked.

Most of these Ushuaia tours are active and involve spending quite a bit of time outdoors, so dress accordingly. Waterproof hiking boots, waterproof hiking pants, and a waterproof jacket are always a good idea!

The weather outside Ushuaia can be cooler and windier, especially if you're heading out into the mountains, so dress in layers and pack a hat, scarf and pair of gloves in your day pack even if you don't think you'll need them.

Keep in mind that some of these tours include hotel pick-up from your accommodations in Ushuaia, while others require you to meet at a pre-designated spot. Always confirm this with your tour operator.

Best El Calafate Day Tours 

1. Glaciers Boat Cruise aboard Maria Turquesa

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 9 hours | ✅ Book it!

First up, I want to start with my favourite El Calafate day tour and that's the boat tour to the glaciers in Los Glaciares National Park!

This tour is definitely a bit of a splurge and we were a bit hesitant to book it, but it turned out to be our favourite experience of the whole trip to El Calafate. 

We booked the Glaciers Gourmet tour aboard Maria Turquesa and we went for the basic option, which includes a packed gourmet lunch box. However, if you're looking for an even more elevated experience, they have a premium tasting menu that takes place on the top private deck.

The morning of our tour, we were picked up from our accommodations in El Calafate and drove to Puerto Bandera, a private port where we boarded our vessel.

We then spent the day cruising the teal waters of Lago Argentino, the largest freshwater lake in Argentina, and along the way, we visited multiple glaciers!

We got to see Seco Glacier, Heim Glacier, Spegazzini Glacier, Upsala Glacier, and Bertacchi Glacier, before ending the day in front of the one and only Perito Moreno Glacier!

But it wasn't just about the glaciers. We also got to fish chunks of icebergs out of the lake to use the ice for our drinks. We went past glacial waterfalls cascading down mountains. We even disembarked at an old outpost and went on a guided hike at Puesto de Las Vacas. It was an epic day!

This is a full-day tour from El Calafate, but I can honestly say that we weren't bored for one second. Maybe it's because we lucked out with the weather (bright blue sunny skies!), but the ever-changing landscapes kept us entertained the entire day as we alternated between spending time out on the deck and simply admiring the beauty of the park from our seats.

So if you're only going to splurge on one tour in El Calafate, I would make it this one!

""Basically an all day adventure aboard a large tri-hull cruiser that covered most of Lago Argentina. The seating is quite comfortable and the windows are large. Access to the deck on two levels allows everyone space for viewing and photos. There is a photographer on board to provide professional photos of your experience. We paid to include a box lunch and beverage but you can bring your own or upgrade to the luxury lunch and beverages. The boat had a play area for small children. We visited all of the glaciers. Two of them calved while we were watching. We enjoyed great weather. A short hike is available to stretch your legs on land. We enjoyed the experience."" -Jerry

2. Perito Moreno Glacier Mini Trekking

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10 hours | ✅ Book it!

Another super popular day tour from El Calafate that tends to sell out in advance is the Perito Moreno Glacier mini trekking excursion. Again, this is another big-ticket item and I'll explain why.

For starters, you're going to be walking on a glacier! That means crevasses and seracs, which require a lot of skill to navigate. This is where a professional guide comes in.

For this activity, you set out in groups of 20 with 1 guide for every 10 participants. Crampons are provided as well as an explanation of how to use them and how to stay safe on the glacier. 

You walk where your guide walks and you step where your guide steps. There is no deviating ever!

The tour itself includes transportation to and from El Calafate. Once you reach the national park, you're driven to Bajo las Sombras Pier, which is about 6 km from the balconies. Here, you embark on a 20-minute navigation across the Rico Arm towards the Perito Moreno Glacier.

You first trek along the shores of this glacial-fed lake, and then once you reach the actual glacier, you gear up for the big adventure. 

It's possible to book this tour in person for slightly cheaper once you're already in El Calafate, however, as I've mentioned, this is one experience that sells out several days in advance, especially during high tourist season (December to March).

If you're going to be in El Calafate for a while, you can take your chances and try to book once you arrive, but if you only have a couple of days and you know you want to go on this tour, it's better to reserve ahead of time. 

Note that Hielo y Aventura is the only operator that runs this Perito Moreno Glacier tour!

""This is by far one of the coolest things I've ever gotten to do. The entire time we just kept looking around us in awe of where we actually were. Definitely go do this. It's easy with the tour company taking care of everything and the route being kept very safe and clear. Crampons are not hard to walk with if you follow the instructions of your guide. I highly recommend crossing ""trek on a glacier"" off of your bucket list."" -Leah

3. Estancia Nibepo Aike

⭐️ RATING: 4/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: Full or half day | ✅ Book it!

Another popular day tour from El Calafate is to visit an estancia or a working ranch. This is one of our favourite experiences whenever we travel to Patagonia as it's a window to rural life and gaucho culture in Argentina.

Estancia Nibepo Aike is a great option because it's relatively accessible (just a 90-minute drive from El Calafate) and it's also located inside Los Glaciares National Park (its existence predates the park!) so that means you get some truly impeccable views of glacial lakes and snow-capped mountains. 

When it comes to visiting Estancia Nibepo Aike on a day trip, you can opt for a full-day excursion or a half-day excursion. The main difference is the horseback riding component - a 3-hour horse ride for the full-day option, or a 1-hour ride for the half-day option. Alternatively, if you don't want to ride, you can enjoy a hike around the estancia.

We personally opted for the half-day excursion and we felt like it was plenty of time (you can read about our experience at Estancia Nibepo Aike here). 

Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with warm beverages and a spread of cakes and baked goods.

We then went on a guided tour of the estancia where we explored the shores of Lago Argentino, climbed up to a viewpoint that offers beautiful panoramic views, and attended a sheep-shearing demonstration. 

This was followed by a feast of a BBQ which featured various cuts of meat including chorizo, morcilla, lamb and salad accompanied by a bottle of red wine. For dessert, we had flan with dulce de leche. 

After the meal, we still had a bit of free time to roam around the estancia, so we took lots of photos and befriended the estancia dogs.

There are lots of cool estancias in and around El Calafate, some of which are open to day visitors and some that welcome overnight guests, so that's another option to consider. 

""Loved everything that was part of our trip - breathtaking views, farm life all around us, horse ride, sheep shearing shown to us, and a wonderful dinner offered! we told our friends and highly recommended them this activity in El Calafate. We might even return ourselves, on the next trip."" -Irina

4. Punta Walichu Archaeological Site

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 hours | ✅ Book it!

Punta Walichu Archaeological Site is an easy half-day tour from El Calafate that doesn't involve travelling long distances. This is a fun activity if you're looking to fill a bit of free time with an easy excursion. 

Here you’ll find several caves located at the foot of a cliff on the shores of Lago Argentino and inside those caves are ancient rock paintings which are believed to be over 4,000 years old! 

The first inhabitants of these lands arrived during the Glacial Age and are believed to have been the predecessors of the Tehuelches.

The cave paintings at Punta Walichu depict images of outlined hands, hunting methods, and the animals that roamed the area.

This tour ends with either lunch or dinner served in one of the caves overlooking Lake Argentino. Quite the special setting, if you ask me!

The menu features a homemade soup for the entree, a lamb casserole with vegetables for the main (or sautéed vegetables if you're vegetarian), and chocolate mousse for dessert. As for drinks, guests can choose between wine, juice and mineral water. 

""We decided on this half day tour and frankly were not sure what to expect We really enjoyed the information shared by our guide, the party we travelled with and the beautiful vistas of Lago Argentina as well as the history of the native peoples, their ancient writings and stories of their culture and lives. Finally the catered lunch set up in the cave environment with a view of the natural surroundings was amazing and delicious We UNEQUIVOCALLY recommend you take this journey You won’t be sorry!"" -Grace

5. Balconies of Calafate

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3-4 hours | ✅ Book it!

If you're looking for another half-day tour from El Calafate, you may want to consider a 4×4 off-road adventure to explore the rugged and pristine landscapes of the Patagonian region.

Balcones de Calafate or the Balconies of Calafate is a panoramic lookout point behind the town of El Calafate. This destination can be reached by 4×4 and offers multiple vantage points where you can see the turquoise waters of Lago Argentino and the majestic peaks of the Andes Mountain Range. 

Some tours go up to Cerro Frias while others go to Cerro Huyliche.

The off-road routes traverse areas with unique flora and fauna, so you have a good chance of observing the local wildlife, including guanacos, foxes, and various bird species.

""Ruben, our guide, made this adventure so enjoyable. He truly loves all his guests. We had a fun trip up the mountain with great views of El Calafate, Lago Argentino, and the snow-covered Andes. Then he made us a tasty lunch before heading back down the mountain to our hotel. We highly recommend this tour."" -William

6. La Leona Petrified Forest

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 8 hours | ✅ Book it!

La Leona Petrified Forest offers a landscape that's completely different from the glaciers and turquoise lakes of El Calafate, so it's a fun option if you want to get a taste of the Patagonian steppe.

The first stop of the day is Hotel La Leona, a roadside rest stop and countryside guesthouse that unknowingly housed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for over a month before they fled Argentina for Chile!

You then embark on a guided hike through the lunar-like landscape of La Leona Petrified Forest.

This part of the tour takes you into a deep depression in the landscape where you can find petrified tree trunks that are around 70 million years old! 

Some of these trees are up to 1.20 meters in diameter and they echo of a time when the climate in this part of the world was very different and supported a completely different type of vegetation!

Aside from the petrified trees, it is also possible to see fossilized dinosaur bones and unique rock formations. 

The duration of the actual trek is 3 hours, though this also depends on the weather and the group's pace. A boxed picnic lunch is included on this day tour.

It's also important to note that this is a seasonal tour that operates from October to April.

""We were both happy we decided to go on this tour. The landscape is something else and the fact that I got to physically hold a piece of wood which was now stone still is one of my vivied memories of nearly three weeks in different parts of Argentina. The guides were informative and very friendly!"" -Helene

7. Kayaking La Leona River

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 8 hours | ✅ Book it!

Kayaking La Leona River is a full-day tour from El Calafate and it's a nice option for travellers who want to spend an active day out on the Patagonian steppe!

This particular tour takes place in La Leona, an outpost located halfway between El Calafate and El Chaltén.

On this tour, you'll kayak the waters of La Leona River, which connects Lago Argentino to Lago Viedma. The waters are a beautiful light blue milky colour due to the glacial sediment from Viedma Glacier.

Wetsuits are provided and you're accompanied by a professional guide every step of the way. 

But you won't spend the whole day on the water! After kayaking down La Leona River, you'll pull into the shore to embark on a guided hike to La Leona Petrified Forest, where you can see dinosaur fossils and walk among ancient petrified tree trunks that date back millions of years!

""Excellent guides - friendly and knowledgeable - they not only made the day fun but also kept everyone safe on the river. It felt such a privilege to kayak the La Leona river and walk the badlands without another soul in sight. It was our group and the guanacos! This trip will ensure you fall in love with Patagonia (if you hadn't already)!"" -Carol

8. Estancia Cristina

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 11 hours | ✅ Book it!

Another very famous estancia near El Calafate, albeit a bit more difficult to access, is Estancia Cristina. This estancia is located inside Los Glaciares National Park and the only way to reach it is by boat, which is an adventure in and of itself. 

This remote ranch is steeped in history and dates back to 1914. It was founded by Joseph and Jessie Masters, a couple who came from the United Kingdom to start a new life in this corner of Patagonia.

What makes this estancia unique is that it's the only property that has a land-based lookout point to the Upsala Glacier.

This day tour begins with a 45-kilometer drive from El Calafate to Puerto Bandera. Here you'll board a vessel where you'll be welcomed with hot drinks and medialunas. 

You'll then begin a 3-hour navigation across Lago Argentino cruising past icebergs and snow-capped mountains on your journey to the estancia. 

Once you reach Estancia Cristina, you'll go on a guided tour of the property and then you'll have two options: an off-road 4x4 tour to Upsala Glacier or a hike to a pristine nearby waterfall. This El Calafate day trip ends with a traditional Argentine lunch at the estancia.

""Despite the high price tag, this day trip is worth the money. It is well organized; the service and amenities were excellent and the experiences are one of a kind. The first part of the day is a cruise near the Upsala glacier and navigating in close proximity to ice bergs floating in Lago Argentino. That is followed by one of the adventure tours at Estancia Cristina. We chose the 4x4 track to view the glaciers: amazing views, but be aware that it is about 90 minutes inside the vehicle. The lunch at the Estancia was a gourmet experience. The whole Estancia Cristina team made everything first class."" -Michael

9. El Chaltén

⭐️ RATING: 4/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 12 hours | ✅ Book it!

While it is possible to visit El Chaltén on a day trip from El Calafate, the question you should ask yourself is: should you?

I think it really depends on the type of traveller you are and your goal for the visit! 

The first thing you should know about El Chalten is that it's the National Trekking Capital of Argentina. This destination draws avid mountaineers and while hiking is the main draw, you can also enjoy rock climbing, kayaking, horse trekking and all sorts of other outdoor adventures. 

As an avid hiker myself, I'm inclined to say that visiting El Chalten on a day trip from El Calafate is simply not worth it. The drive there takes around 3 hours, the most epic hikes merit a full day and should be started in the morning, plus it's the kind of town where it's worth lingering for a few days. But that only applies if you like hiking!

When does it make sense to visit El Chalten on a day trip from El Calafate? I would say it makes sense if you want to visit one more town, enjoy the scenery during the drive, and you're a less active traveller who is more of a walker than a hiker. 

On the drive to El Chalten from El Calafate, you'll get to enjoy views of the Patagonian steppe, the milky waters of lakes and rivers fed by glacial runoff, you'll stop at the La Leona outpost that hid Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and you'll catch a glimpse of Mount Fitz Roy at the end of the highway as you approach the town. 

Once you arrive in town, you'll have the opportunity to go on two very easy and light hikes accompanied by a guide. The first is Chorrillo del Salto where you can see a glacier-fed waterfall set amid the woodland. 

The second is El Mirador De Los Condores, a lookout point that offers panoramic views of El Chalten where you can often see vultures flying overhead. This is an out-and-back 2.6-kilometre trail that takes 45 minutes to complete.

You then get free time in the town to eat lunch (which is included in this tour) and to walk around or browse for souvenirs. That's the day trip!

Now, I've done both of these light hikes and while they are nice, they pale in comparison to the scenery you can witness if you're willing to do the more challenging treks in El Chalten. 

I would say, if your itinerary allows for it, it's worth spending at least 3 days in El Chalten. But I also understand that not everybody is a hiker, so it's a decision you need to make for yourself. 

""Perfect day. Guide and driver were awesome. The hikes were very simple, but intensely beautiful. Lunch was actually one of the better meals I’ve had in Argentina. Definitely recommend."" -Jackson

10. Torres del Paine, Chile

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 14 hours | ✅ Book it!

Can you visit Torres del Paine National Park, Chile on a day trip from El Calafate, Argentina?

Technically, yes you can, and there are even day tours that will take you there, however, you have to be prepared for a very long day. 

Having personally visited Torres del Paine, I think it merits at least a couple of days (more if you want to tackle some of the more popular hikes like the W Trek and the O Trek!), however, sometimes you're limited by your travel time. 

If you only have one day to visit Torres del Paine and you know you won't be back in this remote corner of the globe any time soon, then do it.

So what can you expect from this El Calafate day tour to Torres del Paine National Park?

For starters, you need to be prepared for a very early start! The bus will begin picking up passengers at 06:30 a.m. and then drive to the Argentina-Chile border where everyone will have to go through immigration. Don't forget to bring your passport!

Once you've made it across the border, there will be a stop at an outpost called El Ovejero in Cerro Castillo. Here you'll have the opportunity to use the restrooms, have a quick coffee break, and pick up a souvenir or two if you so wish (I bought leg warmers and an alpaca sweater here!).

This is also your opportunity to exchange some money and get Chilean pesos to pay for the national park admission fee, or you can pay in USD if you have crisp bills without any rips, folds or stains. 

Once you reach Torres del Paine National Park, you'll get to see a few of the highlights. These include landmarks like Laguna Amarga, the Paine Towers, Paine Waterfall, Nordenskjold Lake, the Pehoe Lake Lookout Point and more. 

Most of the scenery will be admired from the bus as you drive through the national park, however, there will also be brief stops for photo ops ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, plus a 2-hour hike to Lake Pehoé and Lake Nordenskjöld. 

Torres del Paine is home to all sorts of wildlife including lots of guanacos, foxes and condors, and if you're particularly lucky you might get to see pumas!

So yes, this tour involves a long day of travel, but the landscapes are breathtaking. The decision is yours!

""A long day, worth every minute. The guide Nicolas was very good. All day explaining in both Spanish and (good) English. He knows what he is talking about, very good explanations. No significant delay at the border and in case this would be so, no blamage on the organization. For the trip many experiences and photography depends on the weather. Fortunately we were very lucky. A wonderful trip."" -George

One of my favourite ways to end a visit to Buenos Aires is by booking an estancia stay in the city outskirts. Buenos Aires is a thriving metropolis packed with activities - cafes, restaurants, museums and art galleries! However, it's nice to have the opportunity to unwind after an action-packed trip.

Most estancias near Buenos Aires are located in Buenos Aires Province, which encircles the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and many of them are just a 1-2 hour drive away, making them fairly accessible to travellers.

My favourite aspect about estancia stays is slipping into the slow pace of life. You can watch the sunrise over the pampas, go horseback riding through the countryside, enjoy traditional Argentine meals, and all of this in a rustic yet luxurious setting.

Over the years, my husband and I have enjoyed many Buenos Aires estancias on both day trips and overnight stays. We've done even more estancia stays down in Patagonia and it has become our favourite way to travel. 

So today, I've created a list of some of the best estancias near Buenos Aires for you to consider! The idea is to give you a bit of inspiration if you're looking to enjoy that estancia life for yourself. I've already experienced a handful of these and the others are still on the travel bucket list.

""We've previously stayed in estancias in the area, so were able to make a comparison. We found the owner and staff to be very welcoming and keen to accommodate our needs. The home cooked meals were tasty, especially the empanadas and cakes. The rooms were nicely decorated with light colours and were full of character. The horses appeared to be well cared for and, as experienced riders, we were taken on the most fabulous ride through the extensive grassland. My horse was amazingly responsive to the lightest touch. The dogs were a pleasure to have around too."" - Claire from Australia

Estancia Puesto Viejo

Best estancia for polo players and a giant labyrinth

Estancia Puesto Viejo is set on 220 hectares of land in Cañuelas 76 kilometres, or less than one hour, from Buenos Aires. 

This particular estancia offers various types of accommodations to suit different budgets. They have a 10-bedroom hotel where all the rooms are named after the owner's favourite polo horses. 

We stayed in the estancia hotel when we visited a few years back. The rooms were decorated with antique furniture including a beautiful wooden armoire, a footboard bench, and a chandelier.

Aside from the hotel, Estancia Puesto Viejo also offers a glamping option. There's a sector of the property where they have built wooden platforms that hold 21 geodomes. Guests can choose between double and triple domes. Just note that the geodomes won't give you access to the swimming pool.

One of the unique draws to this particular estancia is the giant labyrinth - an especially attractive proposition if you're visiting with kids! We had a hard time finding out way out of there!

In terms of activities, there are free bikes to explore the estancia grounds, you can sign up for a short horseback ride, or you can even book a polo lesson. 

Also, we were very well fed for the duration of our stay with 4 meals per day: breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner!

""Great place for relax and to be in touch with nature. If you are a horse fan there is no better place, no matter your age. 100 times better to connect to the airport than from central BsAs. The staff is great always ready to satisfy any need. Food is amazing!!! My only complaint is that I got used to be woken up by bird's songs in the morning and I don't know how I will manage now without…"" - Ed

Estancia La Bamba de Areco

Best estancia for a historic connection

Estancia La Bamba de Areco is a highly acclaimed Relais & Chateaux property located just outside the gaucho town of San Antonio de Areco.

The estancia dates from 1830 making it one of the oldest Argentinian colonial-style estancias in the area. One of the original post houses on the property actually formed part of the Camino Real or Royal Road, an old trade route that connected Buenos Aires with Alto Perú (modern-day Bolivia).

La Bamba de Areco was one of the first estancias to welcome visitors back in the 1980s. It has since been renovated and offers 11 rooms and suites. The decor features dark wooden floors and antique furnishings.

""Our girls trip took us to La Bamba on our recent trip to Argentina. It was such a unique experience -- from the scenery to the horseback riding to the communal meals with people we otherwise would have never met! We definitely recommend this spot for a couple of nights to get out of Buenos Aires and enjoy a very slowed down (little wifi!), relaxing experience. Special shout out to Michaela, Segundo, Jo, and Eduardo for making our experience so special."" - Melissa from New York

Estancia La Madrugada

Best estancia for a luxurious and private stay

Another estancia to visit near Buenos Aires is La Madrugada. This is a rather exclusive property with only 3 suites that lead out to a garden, so it's the ideal place to book with a group of friends or family. 

The estancia offers a rural experience with a touch of luxury. The main farmhouse has been renovated to add modern comforts, however, the place still manages to retain its traditional charm.

Meals at Estancia La Madrugada consist of a three-course menu and outdoor barbecues. Ingredients are sourced directly from the organic garden providing guests with a farm-to-table dining experience.

As far as activities go, Estancia La Madrugada offers horse riding, live guitar music by the campfire, and the opportunity to visit the nearby gaucho town of San Antonio de Areco - the town is only 5-kilometres away, so you can even cycle there using the free bikes they provide.

""My wife and I have been to La Madrugada twice now (one on August - winter, and once in the end of November - summer). Both times very different due to the season - but both incredible. This is a small estancia (max 3 bedrooms) so you really feel like you have the entire estancia (ranch) to yourself. All meals are included, food is great, nice wine selection. Entire staff is personalized and very accommodating! We have a 6 month old baby - and the entire staff could not be more helpful. In the winter they have a great space with a fire, very relaxing to play games or read. In the summer they have an enormous pool - plenty of space - beautiful setting. There is also the option to go horseback riding with a professional guide - again all personalized (riding offered at all levels). The estancia itself is an old traditional home that’s been renovated - keeping its old charm and decor but will all the needed modern amenities to stay comfortable (great shower, airconditioning, etc.) If you are looking for a place to relax out in the country side, quiet setting, personalized service - I could not recommend La Madrugada more."" - Philip

Estancia La Sofia

Best estancia to play polo

Estancia La Sofia is a boutique hotel and polo ranch situated in Azcuénaga some 130 kilometres west of Buenos Aires. 

La Sofía is a colonial-style ranch that offers six spacious en-suite rooms. Guests can choose from 2 Grand Suites, 2 Superior Suites, and 2 Standard Suites. 

There are plenty of ways to keep busy at this estancia with lots of fun activities on offer. Guests can enjoy horseback riding through the pampas, birdwatching, the outdoor swimming pool, and cooking classes where you can learn to make empanadas, asado and mate.

Polo is a big part of life at this estancia. La Sofia Polo Club is part of the Argentine Polo Association and the club has two polo fields.

Whether you want to practice polo, learn to play, or find out more about a sport, the estancia can organize a special program for you. And if you don't feel comfortable on a horse, of course, you can watch a polo game!

""Our stay was absolutely magical. The place is so charming and feels like a friend’s country house. The chef is incredible and you feel as if you have stumbled upon a wonderful part of Argentinian life. The horses are great to ride for all levels and we (both occasional riders) really enjoyed the polo lesson too. I was skeptical about learning polo since I didn’t think it would be rewarding as a beginner but it was so so much fun. If you are there during a polo match that’s a lovely experience and the pool is great too. A really peaceful oasis, with roaring fires in the evening when it is cold, and Al fresco dining when it is sunny. The hotel only sleeps a small number of guests so is truly boutique and we loved getting to know the other guests as well. Would love to revisit if I am back in Argentina."" - Flo

""We went for my birthday with a group of 10 people. The service was excellent, Emiliano and Juli made sure everything worked perfectly. Regarding the food, we brought the raw materials and the ranch staff took care of everything, allowing us to relax and enjoy the stay. Amelia was super attentive, she cooked very well for us and adapted to the dietary restrictions of some guests very easily. All the facilities were in very good condition, the beds were very comfortable and there was always someone making sure that the campfires had a fire to maintain the temperature of the common spaces. We were able to take a horse ride in the morning and in the afternoon Emiliano and Sergio took us to another area where they explained to us better how to handle the horse. It was a great experience! I recommend the stay to go with friends or family to spend a few days, the place is beautiful, the service is excellent and the prices are very reasonable."" - Ariel

Best estancia for a glamping experience

Estancia Las Marias falls into the glamping category offering some rather unique accommodations! Guests can choose between sleeping in a grain silo or a geodome. Rooms can be arranged to fit a queen-sized bed or two single beds. 

This setup is ideal for visitors who want to enjoy a self-catered holiday. Breakfast is served daily, however, lunch and dinner are up to you! The accommodations come with an electric kettle, an electric oven and a small fridge - you'll want to plan for quick and easy meals, which leave more time for exploring. 

On the premises, guests can enjoy the outdoor swimming pool and sauna, visit the local farm animals (pigs, horses, goats and more!), and spend the evenings around the campfire.

""We had a great stay. I wanted to highlight the attention of Lucas and Ivan, very kind and respectful. In the place you are constantly surrounded by many animals. I also wanted to clarify that the breakfast is very complete, I am celiac and they had prepared a variety of options.

Travel tips for choosing an estancia near Buenos Aires

Book an estancia for the end of your trip. This is such a nice way to unwind after a busy itinerary in Buenos Aires. Two nights at an estancia is the perfect way to pamper yourself before hopping on a flight home. As a bonus, a lot of these Buenos Aires estancias are near Ezeiza International Airport. 

Not all estancias are created equal. You'll hear this over and over again! We've done enough estancia stays across Argentina to attest to that. The estancia experience will vary from one establishment to the next. Some estancias only serve breakfast while others provide four meals per day. Certain estancias include activities while others charge an additional fee for things like horse riding or polo lessons. There are estancias geared towards couples and estancias better suited to accommodate families.

Choose an estancia based on your interests. Many Buenos Aires estancias have a focus, whether it be showcasing gaucho culture, horseback riding, or polo lessons. Meanwhile, if you venture further down to Patagonia, you can find estancias that specialize in fly fishing or game hunting. Estancias in Mendoza featuring wine tastings and vineyard visits. While estancias in Cordoba are a great introduction to gaucho culture in the sierras. So there's something out there for everyone.

You can find estancias all over Argentina. If you enjoy the estancia experience, seek them out on the rest of your travels across Argentina! You can find loads of estancias in Patagonia. One of our favourites is Estancia Tecka for fly fishing and unmatched service. Meanwhile, if you're visiting El Calafate, Estancia Nibepo Aike is a fun estancia for a taste of ranch life. You can also find loads of estancias in Córdoba up in the sierras, Mendoza and the Iberá Wetlands. Or try something different like glamping across Patagonia!

Book a Día de Campo to visit for the day. If an overnight stay at an estancia is not in your budget, you can consider visiting for the day. Many estancias near Buenos Aires offer a Día de Campo or 'countryside day' where you visit for the day, learn about gaucho culture and have an Argentine BBQ for lunch. This estancia day tour is one of the most popular day trips from Buenos Aires and it's also highly rated!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,126bc3335d4d2ae526e5e234b86017ea5ee4339d

We have spent a lot of time travelling across some of the best places in Patagonia, and the Province of Chubut has quickly become one of our favourite destinations in the country.

Why do we like visiting Chubut so much?

Because of the variety it offers!

In Chubut you can explore an oil town or have tea in a Welsh town, hike through strange rock formations in the Patagonian steppe or marvel at a 1000-year old tree in the forest, stand in front of the largest dinosaur in the world or tackle the biggest labyrinth in South America.

The landscapes are varied, the activities are endless, and the climate boasts four distinct seasons making it a fun year-round destination. And because this is Northern Patagonia, it's a shorter flight to get there.

Here are our reasons for visiting Chubut in Patagonia, Argentina:

Discover the diversity of landscapes

The province of Chubut stretches from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east, and that means you can experience a variety of geographies along the way!

Whether you want to marvel at snow-capped mountains and hanging glaciers, experience the wilderness of the dry Patagonian steppe, or splash around in the ocean and witness all sorts of wildlife, you can do so all in one province.

The nice thing about Chubut is that you get to experience real seasons. Summers are hot and best spent along the coast, and winters offer a myriad of outdoor activities if you head over to the mountains.

Experience Welsh culture

Did you know there are Welsh towns in Patagonia?

Argentina is a nation that experienced many waves of European immigration, and the Province of Chubut is where Welsh immigrants chose to settle.

The Welsh arrived in 1865 aboard a ship called the Mimosa, and though they first settled along the coast, they eventually moved inland to the Chubut Valley, and slowly ventured over to places like Trevelin along the Andes.

The town of Gaiman is a really interesting place to visit because here you have this Welsh town in the middle of Patagonia and the business names are in Welsh, the foods on the menu are Welsh, and you have countless tea houses serving up Bara brith cake.

It kind of makes you look around like, “Where am I?”

Around town you can also visit the homes of the early settlers, learn how the native Tehuelche helped the newly arrived immigrants survive in a climate they were completely unprepared for, and you can also visit the farms of Welsh descendants to buy fresh fruits and homemade preserves.

If you’re going to be travelling near Puerto Madryn or Trelew, it’s worth the detour to visit, even if it’s just on a day trip. There are even day tours from Puerto Madryn - like this Welsh colonies tour - where you can experience Gaiman as part of a guided visit.

Attend the biggest BBQ festival

Another reason to visit the province of Chubut is to experience the biggest BBQ in the world!

Every year, thousands of people descend on the small town of Cholila to take part in an event unlike any other, the Fiesta Nacional del Asado, also known as the National Asado Festival.

If there’s one thing you should know about Argentines is that they are very much a meat-loving country. The asado is the national dish and it’s not just a meal but rather an experience.

Going to an asado is a full-day event that involves starting a fire from scratch, enjoying each other's company and conversation, snacking on empanadas, opening a few bottles of wine, eating some choripan, cracking jokes around the fire, savouring the fresh air and sunshine, feasting on various cuts of meats, and this can go on for hours!

Now take this and turn it into the biggest party of the year with tens of thousands of kilos of meat to grill, thousands of attendees, live music and dancing, horse competitions and races, and you’ve got yourself a meat festival!

It’s a one-of-a-kind event with great energy, so if you’re planning to travel in Argentina in the month of February, you may want to include a visit to Chubut!

This destination is a prime example of Patagonia off-the-beaten-path - a little harder to get there, but well worth the effort.

See the largest dinosaur in the world

Want to see the dinosaurs that once roamed Patagonia?

Then come and visit the province of Chubut!

There are plenty of things to do in Trelew, however, your first stop should be the Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum, also known as the Dinosaur Museum!

This museum is named after Egidio Feruglio, an Italian-born geologist who spent a great part of his career in Argentina, and it’s also where you’ll be able to see the largest dinosaur in the world, the Patagotitan Mayorum.

This titanosaur was discovered in early 2013 by a group of museum researchers who were on a routine field trip. Well, they made quite the discovery, because it turns out this is the largest known creature to have walked the Earth!

The Patagotitan Mayorum was over 8 meters tall, 40 meters in length, and would have weighed around 74 tons.

This was a huge discovery given the size of the dinosaur and the number of fossils that were found, but perhaps what’s even more impressive is that no less than seven colossal herbivorous dinosaurs were found in a single site right here in the Province of Chubut!

If you’re still craving more after your museum visit, head north on Ruta 3 just outside of Trelew and you’ll find a sculpture of the largest dinosaur in the world (it's just across from the international airport). There you’ll see the Patagotitan mayorum face to face.

If you prefer joining a tour, there are excursions from Puerto Madryn - like this one - that include a visit to Trelew, Gaiman and Punta Tombo to see penguins!

Visit Butch Cassidy's Ranch

Did you ever watch the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid?

Well, here you can see where the real story unfolded.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were outlaws who made a career out of robbing banks and trains. Eventually, the pressure of pursuing law enforcement forced them to leave the country, and where did they end up if not in Patagonia, Argentina.

They bought a ranch in Cholila with the money from their robberies and changed their names - it is said they were trying to lead honest lives. However, law enforcement was already onto them so they sold the ranch and went on the run again.

Today, you can still visit the infamous ranch, which is in such a rural out-of-the-way area, that you’re almost guaranteed to have it to yourself.

Marvel at a 2,600-year-old tree

One place you simply cannot miss when you visit Chubut is Los Alerces National Park.

The park is set in the Andes Mountains and the western boundary coincides with the Chilean border.

The biggest draw to the park is the Alerce Forest which is home to the second longest living tree species in the world. The alerce tree goes by a few other names including Fitzroya cupressoides, lahuán, and Patagonian cypress, and it grows in the Valdivian temperate rain forests.

The alerce tree can grow to a height of 40-60 metres (though there exist a few 70-metre specimens!), and it can have a trunk diameter of 5 metres.

In Los Alerces National Park, you’ll find the ‘Alerce Milenario’, or the Grandfather tree which is around 2,600+ years old.

Reaching it involves a beautiful boat journey across turquoise waters, past a hanging glacier, and a forest trek down a boardwalk.

You can feel the wisdom in the towering trees and it’s an experience unlike any other.

Hike through strange rock formations

The Province of Chubut boasts some spectacular other-worldly landscapes and Piedra Parada is one such place!

This is a protected natural area with 132 hectares of Patagonian steppe.

The name Piedra Parada literally translates to ‘standing rock’ and that’s thanks to the giant rock which rises 240 meters high next to the Chubut River.

Then, next to this enormous rock, there is a trail that leads into the Cañadón de la Buitrera or the Vulture’s Canyon. The corridor is over 100 meters high and along the way there are Mapuche-Tehuelche cave paintings.

It’s also worth noting that this area is considered rock climbing mecca, so if you’re into the sport, you’ll have a lot of fun here!

Witness wildlife like nowhere else

Another reason to visit the Province of Chubut is to view wildlife in Península Valdés. Trust me, this place will blow your mind!

The peninsula is considered one of the best places to see wildlife in all of Patagonia. You can spot sea lions, elephant seals, Southern right whales, Magellanic penguins, rheas, guanacos, maras and more!

Whether you’re driving across the arid steppe or joining a boat tour of the Golfo Nuevo, you are bound to encounter wildlife at every turn.

The peninsula is accessed via the port city of Puerto Madryn, or you can also opt to stay in Puerto Pirámides, which is a hippie beach town and the only community on the whole peninsula.

You can do a full-day tour of Peninsula Valdés departing from Puerto Madryn including stops at the Carlos Ameghino Isthmus Visitor Centre, Puerto Pirámides, Península Valdés and Caleta Valdés.

Ride the Old Patagonian Express

If you're a train enthusiast, another reason to visit the Province of Chubut is to ride the Old Patagonian Express.

This train journey rose to fame soon after the release of Paul Theroux's 1978 novel The Old Patagonian Express. In his book, Theroux sets out to travel by train from his hometown in Massachusetts all the way down to Argentina, and based on the book's title, Patagonia clearly made a strong impression on him!

The Old Patagonian Express, known as La Trochita in Argentina, once stretched out across 402 kilometres and it was originally planned as part of a larger network that would connect all of Patagonia.

Today small segments of the original route remain and travellers can choose to ride one of three journeys from Esquel to Nahuel Pan, El Maiten to Desvio Bruno Thomaé, or Ingeniero Jacobacci to Ojos de Agua.

Tackle the biggest labyrinth

The town of El Hoyo is home to Laberinto Patagonia, which just so happens to be the biggest labyrinth in South America!

Nestled in a 5-hectare estate, the labyrinth is surrounded by native forests and spectacular views of the surrounding valley.

The labyrinth itself is 8,000 square meters, with 2,200 metres worth of paths to find your way around. It’s a really fun activity whether you’re visiting as a couple, with family or with friends.

The views when you emerge from the labyrinth are reward enough, however, if you want to treat yourself to something sweet, there’s a tea house on site that you really should visit!

I would highly recommend ordering a slice of their chocolate cake with blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, gooseberries and strawberries. And if that weren’t decadent enough, it also has dulce de leche and whipped cream. It’s one of the best cakes you’ll try in your life!

Visit an oil town

If you enjoy going off the beaten path and visiting places that most tourists skip altogether, then I’d recommend checking out the coastal city of Comodoro Rivadavia. This was one of the many stops on our coastal Patagonia travel itinerary.

When we first told people that our travels across Patagonia were going to include a stop in the oil city of Comodoro Rivadavia, most people looked at us with bewildered eyes and asked, “why?!”

Well, why not?

Comodoro Rivadavia is the largest city in the Province of Chubut and it offers quite a bit to see and do. We really enjoyed our visit to the Petroleum Museum to learn about the discovery of oil that in turn gave rise to this city. This stop is a must for anyone visiting.

Aside from that, the city has excellent seafood restaurants, you can enjoy some great panoramic views from Chenque Hill, and you can also go on a day trip to the neighbouring beachside town of Rada Tilly.

So, has this convinced you to give the Province of Chubut a visit? We certainly hope so! Let us know what destination in Chubut you'd most like to experience!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,c712a70f8afd189c662ddb6e953bd030863ec94d

So you're planning a trip to Ushuaia and you're not quite sure where to begin. After all, there are many considerations when it comes to visiting a destination so remote that it quite literally feels like you're journeying to the ends of the Earth. 

Depending on where you are in the planning stages of your trip, you may have a lot of questions like: 

When is the best time to visit Ushuaia? How much time should I allocate to this city? What will the weather be like? How should I pack? And what activities should I not miss?

This Ushuaia travel guide covers some of the best things to do in the city, however, today we're going to focus on some practical travel advice and insider tips to help you make the most of your visit. 

Ushuaia Travel Tips

1. Choose what time of year to visit

Ushuaia is located in the Southern Hemisphere at the very bottom of South America, and each season brings different highlights.

The first step to planning your trip is deciding when is the best time to visit Ushuaia. Your experience will greatly vary depending on the season you choose. 

You may be inclined to think that Ushuaia is a year-round wintry wonderland due to its proximity to Antarctica, however, that is not the case! Ushuaia does have distinct seasons and with that come different activities to enjoy.

During the winter months (June–August), snow sports dominate, and the city exudes a cozy, alpine atmosphere. This is the time of year to go skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and ice trekking. You can also enjoy The Longest Night Festival, which celebrates the winter solstice.

Summer in Ushuaia (December–February), brings longer days with up to 18 hours of daylight. This season provides ideal conditions for hiking, wildlife tours, and even penguin encounters. 

Meanwhile, spring (September–November) and autumn (March–May) are shoulder seasons with fewer crowds and often better deals, though weather can be more volatile. 

All this to say, that the best time to visit Ushuaia depends entirely on the activities you want to enjoy, but you can visit year-round.

2. Pack for unpredictable weather

Having said all of the above, you still need to pack for unpredictable weather no matter what time of year you choose to visit!

Ushuaia is known for having four seasons in one day and we got to experience that firsthand. We visited in summer and witnessed sunshine and clear skies that turned into freezing rain, plus intense winds that forced us to cancel one of our treks!

Hence, it is crucial to pack a variety of clothing layers. Include a waterproof jacket, warm fleece, thermal layers, and sturdy footwear. 

Don’t forget accessories like gloves, a warm hat, and sunglasses to protect against both sun and glare from snow or water.

3. Book in advance if visiting in the summer

Another important Ushuaia travel tip is to book your accommodations in advance, especially if you're planning to visit during the summer months. 

Summer in Ushuaia is high season and it's when most travellers descend on the southernmost city in the world!

Figuring out where you want to stay in Ushuaia is an important part of the travel equation. 

Accommodations in the city are quite varied and range from luxury hotels overlooking the Beagle Channel to centrally located hostels for those who want to explore the city on a budget.

4. Choose your Beagle Channel cruise carefully 

If there's one activity you should do some research on, it's which Beagle Channel cruise to book. This is another important Ushuaia travel tip because not all tours are created equal!

How do you want to cruise the Beagle Channel? Because there are lots of things to consider.

Larger vessels feel less choppy on the water but you have to share the experience with lots of people, while on smaller vessels you can really feel the waves but you also get a more personalized experience.

Perhaps most importantly, do you want to view penguins from a boat or do you want to disembark and walk among them? This is an important consideration since not all tour operators are permitted to disembark on Martillo Island. 

5. Get outdoors when the weather is good

When the sun comes out, get out there and enjoy all the outdoor activities! Don't think it over twice, because the weather could change by then. 

This is your moment to visit Estancia Haberton, trek to the Emerald Lagoon, canoe on Lapataia Bay or anything else that involves being outside. 

Visiting Ushuaia means being flexible and readjusting your plans according to the weather. 

I would highly recommend booking your must-do tours early on in your visit and that way you can reschedule things for a better day if you must.

6. Plan for a few indoor activity days

Ushuaia’s weather isn’t always ideal for outdoor adventures, so having indoor options is helpful. Thankfully, this city has plenty of attractions to keep you busy on those windy, rainy or snowy days when beyond outdoors isn't an attractive option.

The first place I would recommend visiting is the Prison at the End of the World also known as Ushuaia Prison. The former prison houses multiple museums; one in each of the five wings which then converge in a central hall. These include the Prison Museum, the Maritime Museum, the Antarctic Museum, the Art Museum and the Art Gallery.

You also have the End of the World Museum which is housed across two buildings on Avenida Maipú.

Or if you'd rather see a bit of the city, you can hop on the double-decker bus for a tour of Ushuaia.

7. Splurge on once-in-a-lifetime experiences

There are a few different ways to splurge on experiences in the world's southernmost city.

The first is through your accommodations. If I had to choose one property for a luxurious stay, it would be Arakur Ushuaia Resort & Spa. This is considered to be the best hotel in all of Ushuaia! 

Arakur sits on a natural balcony 800 feet above sea level inside the Reserva Natural Cerro Alarkén which means you have hiking trails just outside the hotel doors. The best part is a heated indoor-outdoor pool offering unparalleled panoramic views of the city and the Beagle Channel. 

Another way to splurge during your stay in Ushuaia is by going on a helicopter flight. You can choose from different flight lengths, however, the most epic is a 30-minute scenic flight which includes a landing in the Andes and a bottle of champagne.

8. Plan and book all your bus transportation

Booking your bus transportation ahead of time is another important tip to keep in mind. 

Ushuaia is connected to Rio Grande, Argentina and Punta Arenas, Chile by bus. There is only one way in via the Fuegian Andes, which means that buses can get fully booked!

Depending on the time of year you visit, there may not be daily connections, so it's important you sort your bus in and out of Ushuaia with plenty of time.

Also, at the time of writing this, Ushuaia doesn't have a real bus terminal. Buses arrive and depart from a parking lot just across from the port, which can be a little confusing for travellers. 

I would suggest buying your bus tickets in advance via Plataforma10 or BusBud. There's nowhere to buy long-distance bus tickets in the parking lot, there are no schedules posted, and no announcements regarding arrivals and departures. It's a fend-for-yourself type of terminal.

The one useful thing you'll find in this parking lot is a booth for a shuttle service to a few different tourist spots in and around Ushuaia. You can book a ride to Tierra del Fuego National Park as well as numerous trailheads in the city outskirts.

You can find more helpful info on how to get to Ushuaia here.

9. Explore Tierra del Fuego National Park

Just a short drive west of Ushuaia, you'll find Tierra del Fuego National Park which offers numerous trails that lead to scenic lookouts, pristine lakes, and peat bogs. We enjoyed the park so much that we spent two days hiking there. 

We dedicated one full day to Senda Costera or the Coastal Trail which follows the Beagle Channel. We hiked from Zaratiegui Bay to Alakush, an 8-kilometre one-way hike that takes 3-4 hours to complete. We first sent postcards and got our passports stamped at the southernmost post office in the world. 

We also hiked in Lapataia Bay, an important spot that marks the end of Argentina’s National Route 3 and the Panamerican Highway. There are a total of 6 trails there, all quite short ranging from 400 meters to 2 kilometres, so it's very doable to complete them in one day.

Of course, another reason to visit Tierra del Fuego National Park is to ride the Train to the End of the World, which is a bucket list activity, especially if you're a train enthusiast! This train journey is a great way to learn about Ushuaia's origins as a penal colony.

10. Try Fuegian cuisine

Now let's talk about Fuegian cuisine because there are certain dishes you simply have to try when you visit Ushuaia!

Given the city's proximity to the ocean, seafood is an important component of the local cuisine. 

Centolla or king crab, features prominently in most restaurants across town. You can try it in soups, stews and salads. The meat is tender and has a mildly sweet flavour, comparable to lobster.

Merluza negra or Patagonian toothfish is another local seafood dish known for its buttery texture.

As far as meat goes, cordero fueguino or Fuegian lamb, is a regional Argentine dish that is slow-cooked on a stake.

You can pair your meal with a glass of Argentine wine or sample a few locally brewed craft beers, which have become increasingly popular in Patagonia.

11. Arrive a few days early if you're catching a cruise

Last but not least, if you are one of those travellers who is continuing onwards to Ushuaia, try to arrive a few days early.

While there are multiple daily flights from Buenos Aires and a few other select cities, the weather at the end of the world can be quite unpredictable and in cases of extreme wind, flights can be delayed.

You don't want the cruise ship leaving without you because you decided to fly on the same day the ship is leaving port!

I would suggest arriving at least a couple of days early to give yourself a buffer. There's plenty to see and do in Ushuaia and this 3-day itinerary can help you fill some of that time.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,57f9e356abb5aeb2ebbe37e4d085004526d9ac90

Villa La Angostura is surrounded by crystalline lakes, dense forests and rugged mountains, plus its streets are lined with rose bushes, which explains why it's nicknamed 'the Garden of Patagonia'.

The town itself has a very rustic yet cozy alpine feel, with most of the constructions resembling log cabins. Walking its streets feels like something straight out of a woodland fairy tale, but that's just the magic of Villa La Angostura for you.

This is one of the best spots in Patagonia if you're looking for a lakeside holiday and rugged mountains!

How to get to Villa La Angostura

First things first, how do you get to Villa La Angostura?

The best way to get to Villa La Angostura is via Bariloche. Bariloche is the gateway to northern Patagonia, offering daily inbound flights from all over Argentina, so this is where you'll most likely fly into.

Once you get to Bariloche, you can rent a car and do the 1-hour and 20-minute drive to Villa La Angostura along Ruta 40 - a very picturesque 79-kilometre journey along the highway that crosses the length of Argentina from north to south.

Alternatively, you can catch a bus from the Bariloche Bus Terminal. The main bus companies that operate that route are Via Bariloche and Albus.

How many days in Villa La Angostura?

Whether you're visiting Villa La Angostura for a day or staying for a week, there is no shortage of things to do.

Some people choose to visit Villa La Angostura as a day trip from Bariloche, while others will linger for a week of sunshine and lakeside relaxation.

How long you stay is really up to you, however, our recommendation would be to plan for 3-4 days.

You can spend 2 of those days doing the main day trips (Arrayanes Forest and Route of the Seven Lakes) and spend the other 2 days sightseeing around town and soaking in nature.

Things to do in Villa La Angostura

Drive the Road of the Seven Lakes

One of the must-do day trips from Villa La Angostura is to drive the Road of the Seven Lakes, also known as La Ruta de Los Siete Lagos in Spanish.

This is a scenic 107-kilometre drive that stretches from the town of Villa La Angostura in the south to the town of San Martín de Los Andes in the north. The route runs along a stretch of National Route 40, which is the highway that crosses the full length of Argentina from north to south. In other words, it's epic!

It's a beautiful journey that goes past snow-capped mountains, dense forests and pristine lakes. Plus, it crosses two national parks: Lanín National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park.

Driving the Route of the Seven Lakes is something that can be done in one day, independently by renting a car or by joining a guided tour. 

As the name of the drive suggests, there are seven main lakes along this route: Lake Machónico, Lake Escondido, Lake Correntoso, Lake Espejo, Lake Lácar, Lake Falkner, and Lake Villarino.

If you were to drive the Route of the Seven Lakes without making a single stop along the way, it would take just under 2 hours, however, it's best done as a full day trip with plenty of stops along the way.

Tour Nahuel Huapi Lake by boat

There are quite a few different options when it comes to boat trips on Lago Nahuel Huapi. You can sightsee by catamaran, sailboat, or even rent your own boat!

Patagonia Sailing offers sailboat tours that range from 1 to 6 hours, depending on what you want to see.

Then you have Catamarán Futaleufú, a popular option for those wanting to do a catamaran tour to the Arrayanes Forest.

And if you prefer something more active, there are half-day kayaking tours of Nahuel Huapi Lake where you get to explore rock walls, islands and beaches.

The choice is yours!

Visit the magical Arrayanes Forest

One of the main things to do in Villa La Angostura is to visit the Arrayanes Forest, which is believed to have inspired Disney's Bambi.

What's so special about this forest, you ask?

Well, this is where you'll find the arrayán tree, which is easily recognized by its cinnamon-coloured bark.

One unusual thing about this tree is that it always feels cool to the touch. This is because its bark is so thin that you can feel the sap inside.

The main part of the Arrayanes Forest sits on the tip of the Quetrihué Peninsula in Los Arrayanes National Park. Most of the trees in that section of the forest are over 300 years old, though there are a few exemplars that have been standing for over 650 years!

You can reach the Arrayanes Forest by boat or on foot, and I would suggest doing both!

You can take a boat there, learn all about the forest's history on the journey over, and then hike the 12 kilometres back into Villa La Angostura!

The walk back takes about 3 hours to complete, and it's a nice way to enjoy the Patagonian scenery.

Have tea and cake at Cucú Schulz

Our favourite cafe in Villa La Angostura is shaped like a cuckoo clock and its walls are covered in cuckoo clocks. That place is Cucú Shulz!

The Cucú Schulz cake - their very own creation - features a chocolate cake base with semisweet chocolate mousse, chantilly cream, a chocolate glaze and caramelized almonds.

Aside from that, you can order brownie cake, apple pie, cheesecake with wild berries, and my personal favourite, ricotta cake.

They also serve grilled sandwiches, waffles, muffins, alfajores, and don't get me started on their fancy coffees.

We discovered this place right at the start of our visit and went back multiple times!

The cafe is located on Avenida Arrayanes, which is the main thoroughfare in Villa La Angostura. It is open from 9 am to 9 pm, so it's the perfect spot for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a sweet bite any time of day!

Bahía Mansa & Bahía Brava

Villa La Angostura is a town with two bays: Bahía Mansa, meaning 'calm bay', and Bahía Brava, meaning 'wild bay'.

The two bays are divided by the Quetrihué Peninsula, and they are just a 5-minute walk from each other, so you can easily visit them both and see how they live up to their names.

Both bays have their own sandy beaches and they're particularly popular at sunset.

Visit the lagoons and go birdwatching

If you're looking for a bit of nature, but you don't necessarily want to go too far or do anything too strenuous, you can visit the two lagoons in town.

Laguna Calafate is more of a birdwatching spot with bird hides where you can enjoy the local wildlife. They even have posters inside the hides with the names and images of the various birds you can expect to see.

Laguna Verde, on the other hand, is a nice place to go for a walk. The trail is called Sendero de las Lumas and it runs through the forest and follows the lagoon's shore. It's a super peaceful spot and we only saw a handful of locals the whole time we were there.

Visit the European-inspired chapel

Another important attraction in Villa La Angostura is the chapel known as Capilla de la Virgen de la Asunción, which dates back to 1936.

The chapel was designed by renowned Argentine architect Alejandro Bustillo, perhaps best known as the man behind the iconic Llao Llao Hotel.

Bustillo was inspired by northern European architecture when building this chapel; it features a mix of wooden logs, stone walls, black roof tiles, stained glass windows and rustic wooden beams in the interior.

The chapel is set in a forested area, so it does feel like a taste of Europe, even if it's hard to pinpoint exactly where!

Sample the delicious Patagonian Cuisine

It's no secret that El Esquiador is our favourite restaurant in Villa La Angostura and we went back there again and again to sample a great part of their menu.

One of the dishes they are best known for is the Ciervo a la Cazadora, which is a hunter's stew with deer. It is served on top of boiled potatoes and the meat is super tender - no knives required. If you want to try a classic regional dish, this is it.

Trucha, Spanish for trout, is another item that makes an appearance on many Patagonian restaurant menus. We tried the trout done two different ways: with brown butter and capers, and  'Esquiador style' with cheese and a cream of mushrooms. Both were exquisite!

Pair that with a mixed potato and pumpkin puree, or a side of noisette potatoes and you've got magic on a plate.

For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the Flan Casero, a homemade custard dessert with a generous dollop of dulce de leche.

Hang out at El Mercado

El Mercado is a multi-use space in Villa La Angostura meant to capture the magic of the community's early days when the market was a gathering place.

The space is home to a craft brewery, a tapas bar, a pizzeria, and a few cafes.

It's a nice spot that mainly draws people in the evenings.

Try all the Patagonian chocolate

Patagonia is renowned for its artisanal chocolate and in Villa La Angostura, you have multiple shops to choose from!

A few to consider include:

Benroth

Bosque Chocolate

Mamuschka

Chocolates del Turista

Tante Frida

La Campiña del Sur

Punto Chocolate

Amazonia Chocolateria

Ñuke Lemu

There are so many different flavours to sample and you really will want to try them all!

I would suggest ordering an assorted bag and paying by weight so you can try all the unique flavours and discover which ones you like best.

Some of our personal favourites were the dark chocolate with mint cream, the milk chocolate with raspberry cream and anything filled with dulce de leche!

As a bonus, a lot of the chocolate shops in town double as ice cream shops, so your sweet tooth is in for a treat.

See the Correntoso Lake and River

One of the natural attractions in Villa La Angostura is the Correntoso Lake and River.

Correntoso Lake is set within Nahuel Huapi National Park and it flows towards Nahuel Huapi Lake via the Correntoso River.

Correntoso River is considered one of the shortest rivers in the world - it can be anywhere between 200 and 300 meters depending on the water levels - and it's a super popular destination for fly fishing. Trout abounds, especially where the river meets Nahuel Huapi Lake.

Two bridges cross the Correntoso River, one is for vehicles, but there is also a smaller pedestrian bridge where visitors can enjoy the beauty of the lake and river.

Go Fly Fishing

Fly fishing is huge in Patagonia, especially when it comes to fishing for trout!

Whether you're a beginner looking to try fly fishing for the first time or someone with more experience, local guides will take you wading in some of the best rivers as you search for rainbow trout and brown trout.

Aside from fishing, this is a good opportunity to spot local wildlife like condors, foxes and guanacos.

Hike to lakes and waterfalls

There are lots of hiking opportunities in and around Villa La Angostura.

Whether you're looking for an easy 1-kilometre loop in the Arrayanes Forest or something more challenging like the 15.4-kilometre trek to the summit of Cerro Belvedere, there are plenty of options to explore.

All Trails has a great list of treks you can enjoy in Villa La Angostura that includes hikes to rivers, waterfalls, lakes, lagoons and mountain peaks.

Do keep in mind that you need to sign in with the park ranger for some of these trails, so they know when to expect you back.

Where to stay in Villa La Angostura

As a resort town, Villa La Angostura offers a myriad of accommodations ranging from log cabins to lakeside resorts, and there really is something for every budget.

There are a few different areas to choose from. If you want to be right in the centre of town, book something in Villa La Angostura. If you'd rather be close to the lake, opt for Puerto Angostura, which is just south of town. And if you want more of a resort feel, choose something in Puerto Manzano, though you'll want a car since this is more in the outskirts.

Correntoso Lake & River Hotel - 4* hotel set on the Correntoso Lake with unparalleled mountain views, plus a pool, spa and wellness centre

Alma Andina Hosteria - 3* guest house with mountain views and a cozy alpine feel within walking distance of the town centre

Hostería Epulen - 2* inn with lake views and rooms that feel like you're staying in a log cabin

Best Places to Visit in Patagonia, Argentina

El Bolsón

Best place in Patagonia for hiking and epic mountain views.

El Bolsón is one of the best places to visit in Patagonia for hiking and nature. This hippie mountain town offers trails for hikers of all levels, and there's always a reward at the end, be it an epic mountain view or a pristine river to swim in.

The town sits in a valley between two mountain ranges, and it truly is one of the most beautiful places in Patagonia.

Even though this is the best-known town in the Comarca Andina it's still Patagonia off-the-beaten-path.

Best activities in El Bolsón

Visit the Sculpture Forest

One of the main attractions in El Bolsón is the Sculpture Forest, locally known as Bosque Tallado.

The sculpture forest is situated on Cerro Piltriquitrón, and the art project came about after a series of fires burned down part of the mountainside.

Local artist Marcelo López saw the opportunity to create something beautiful out of tragedy and invited a series of artists to create sculptures using the burnt and fallen trees.

This project began in 1998 and is ongoing, with artists being invited every few years to add new works to the Sculpture Forest.

Tackle the hiking trails

El Bolsón is a haven for hiking enthusiasts, offering a plethora of scenic trails and stunning landscapes to explore.

The region is known for its lush forests, crystal-clear rivers, and majestic mountain views, making it an ideal destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers.

Trails range in length and level of difficulty. A few to consider include Cerro Amigo, Cascada Escondida, Cabeza del Indio, Cajón del Azul, and Cerro Piltriquitrón.

Shop at the Hippie Fair

The Hippie Fair, better known as Feria Artesanal, takes place on Plaza Pagano 4 times a week on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

This is a great place to do your souvenir shopping with 200 stalls to browse. You can find everything from ceramics and tapestries to homemade jams and natural cosmetics.

Plus, there are also food trucks on site where you can try Argentine street food like empanadas and choripán.

Drive over to Lago Puelo

As far as day trips from El Bolsón go, Lago Puelo is one of the easiest ones you can do!

Lago Puelo is technically in a different province, but it's only a 30-minute drive across the border.

The lake sits in Lago Puelo National Park, which is home to Valdivian forest, mountain peaks, and hiking trails - including one that reaches the Chilean border.

Sample the ice cream flavours at Jauja

Argentines love their ice cream, and you'll find that ice cream shops abound, even in mountain towns.

We treated ourselves to daily ice cream since we were doing plenty of hiking, and we were big fans of the flavour offerings at Jauja.

Some of their more unique Patagonian ice cream flavours include raspberries with goat's milk, dulce de leche with walnuts and Andean chocolate. These use local ingredients and are pretty inventive.

Villa La Angostura

Best place in Patagonia for high-end resorts by the lake.

Villa La Angostura is a high-end resort town located on the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake in the Province of Neuquén.

The town's Swiss-style architecture features plenty of wooden chalets and log cabins which add to the allure of the town.

Plus, you have pristine forests, crystal-clear lakes, and snow-capped peaks creating a breathtaking backdrop that complements the town's cozy and inviting feel.

It's an idyllic destination that attracts tourists year-round.

Best activities in Villa La Angostura

Arrayanes Forest

The main attraction in Villa La Angostura is the magical Arrayanes Forest, which is located on the Quetrihué Peninsula that juts out into Nahuel Huapi Lake just south of town.

What makes the forest special are the arrayán trees, known for their cinnamon-coloured bar,k which feels cool to the touch. This is because the tree's bark is so thin that you can feel the sap flowing inside the tree.

Most of the trees in the forest are around 300 years old, though there are a few specimens that date back 650 years.

Hike the Quetrihué Peninsula

After visiting the Arrayanes Forest, you have two options: get back on the boat or hike across the peninsula.

The hike is 12 kilometres long and takes about 3 hours to complete.

Visit the two bays

Villa La Angostura is a town of two bays. You have Bahía Mansa, meaning ‘calm bay’, and Bahía Brava, meaning ‘wild bay’.

The two bays are just a 5-minute walk from each other, so it's easy to visit both.

Bahía Mansa is where most boat excursions depart from and where you have that beautiful two-level wooden pier you see in photos, and Bahía Brava has a nice crescent beach, where you can enjoy a stroll and catch the sunset.

Drive the Route of the Seven Lakes

Villa La Angostura is best known as the starting point (or ending point, depending on which direction you drive it!) of the Route of the Seven Lakes.

This is a very picturesque 107-kilometre drive that runs between the towns of Villa La Angostura and San Martín de Los Andes.

The route goes through two national parks, Lanín National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park, and as the names suggest, it also goes past seven lakes.

This drive is best done as a one-day road trip with stops at all the lakes, waterfalls, and scenic points along the way.

Eat in a cuckoo house cafe

Cucu Schulz is a cafe built to look like a cuckoo clock, and inside the walls are covered in even more cuckoo clocks, which is really fun when the clocks strike the hour.

My favourite thing to order at Cucu Schulz is their ricotta cake. You may also want to try their in-house specialty, the Cucu Shulz cake, which consists of a chocolate cake with semisweet chocolate mousse, chantilly cream, a chocolate glaze and caramelized almonds.

Villa Traful

Best place in Patagonia for a quiet lakeside escape.

Villa Traful is a picturesque village located on the southern shore of Lake Traful, surrounded by the Andes Mountains.

The village is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, making it a popular destination for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts.

Getting to Villa Traful involves travelling down rugged gravel roads, but pristine nature and tranquillity are the reward.

Best activities in Villa Traful

Hike to the waterfalls

There are two different waterfalls you can visit in Villa Traful; one is Cascada del Arroyo Coa Co, which is a 40-minute loop, and the other is Cascada del Arroyo Blanco, which is a 60-minute loop.

Both are considered relatively easy hikes.

Visit the submerged forest

Villa Traful boasts a rather unique attraction, and that is the Submerged Forest, where around 60 cypress trees rise from the waters of Lago Traful.

These trees were once on the hillside but became submerged due to a landslide in the 1960s. The crystal-clear waters allow visitors to see the trunks and branches of these submerged trees.

The Submerged Forest can be explored by boat, with excursions departing from the south side of the lake and heading to the forest on the north side.

Go scuba diving

For a more immersive experience, Buceo VLA offers scuba diving excursions to witness the Submerged Forest in all its glory.

Scuba diving in Patagonia does mean cooler temperatures, so you'll wear a 7mm neoprene diving suit.

Try Argentina's most famous alfajores

What is an alfajor, you ask?

An alfajor is a sweet confection consisting of two soft cookies typically filled with dulce de leche, which is a creamy caramel-like spread made from condensed milk. The alfajor can also be coated in white, milk or dark chocolate.

It just so happens that the award-winning alfajores from Del Montañés originate in Villa Traful, so you need to try them if you make it all the way there!

Enjoy Lago Traful

Of course, aside from boating and scuba diving, you can also enjoy some beach time on the shores of Lake Traful.

Plus, if you're looking for something a bit more active, you can rent kayaks or stand-up paddle boards and spend the day out on the water.

Esquel

Best place in Patagonia for train travel and epic day trips.

Esquel is a town set at the foot of the Andes Mountains, and its location makes it a convenient base for exploring the nearby national park as well as some easy day trips.

There are plenty of things to do in Esquel, and right now we're going to cover some of the highlights.

Best activities in Esquel

Ride the Old Patagonian Express

The main thing to do in Esquel is to ride the Old Patagonian Express train!

Locally known as La Trochita, this train was made famous by Paul Theroux’s 1979 novel The Old Patagonian Express, in which he recounted his train journey from his hometown in Massachusetts all the way down to Argentina.

While the railway tracks of the Old Patagonian Express once stretched out across 402 kilometres, today only three short segments of the route can be travelled by tourists.

The most popular segment departs from Esquel to Nahuel Pan. This is a half-day activity where you can travel across the Patagonian steppe, and upon arriving in Nahuel Pan, you can visit an artisanal market, tour the Museum of Patagonian Culture, and enjoy some Argentine street food in the form of a choripán (sausage on a bun)!

Los Alerces National Park

A popular day trip from Esquel is to Los Alerces National Park, one of the most beautiful national parks in Patagonia.

The park is made up of interconnected lakes and rivers that weave their way through the Valdivian forest.

Some of the highlights include riding a boat across waters that shift from emerald to turquoise, seeing hanging glaciers, and visiting the Grandfather Alerce, which is 2,700 years old!

Yes, this park is home to the second-longest living tree species in the world – the alerce, which gives the park its name!

Piedra Parada

For a change of scenery and a taste of the Patagonian steppe, you can consider a day trip to Piedra Parada.

This natural protected area is home to a towering monolith that rises 210 metres from the Chubut Valley. The rock's origins are volcanic, and once upon a time, this area would have been the caldera of an ancient mega volcano.

You can also visit the nearby Vulture's Canyon, which is a really nice area for hiking and rock climbing.

The canyon's walls rise some 150 meters on either side, and along the way, you can see small refuges in the rock that would have been used by the pre-Tehuelches and Tehuelches who inhabited this area in a seasonal manner up to 5000 years ago.

Skiing in La Hoya

If you happen to be visiting Esquel in the wintertime and you're down for some skiing or snowboarding, you'll want to make your way up to La Hoya.

This is the main ski centre in the area, and it's just a 30-minute drive north of town.

You can rent gear, book passes, or sign up for ski and snowboarding lessons directly on their website.

Hike the local trails

Last but not least, Esquel offers plenty of local hiking opportunities.

Laguna La Zeta leads to a lagoon where you can go kayaking or horseback riding. It takes about 1 hour to hike up from the centre of town.

Cerro La Cruz offers beautiful views of Esquel, surrounded by mountains. It's a steep hike, but there are lookouts along the way. It takes about 1.5 hours to reach the top, and there are two different access points via Barrio Baden in the east or Barrio Ceferino on the west.

Trevelin

Best place in Patagonia for wineries and Welsh history.

Trevelin is a small mountain town situated in a picturesque valley surrounded by the Andes Mountains. Its name translates to 'mill town' in Welsh, reflecting its heritage.

Trevelin is known for its access to Los Alerces National Park, fly fishing opportunities, multiple wineries, and its tulip fields in the springtime.

Best activities in Trevelin

Visit the wineries

Did you know there are vineyards and wineries in Patagonia?

It does take a special type of grape to thrive in this climate, but more and more we're seeing winemakers take on the challenge of producing wine in this part of the world.

Some of the wineries you can visit in Trevelin include Viñas del Nant y Fall, Contra Corriente, and Casa Yagüe.

White wines do well at this latitude, so you can expect to find Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. As far as red grapes, it’s all about the Pinot Noir.

Stay at a fishing lodge

Another thing to do in Trevelin is to stay at a fishing lodge. This area is considered one of the best places in Patagonia for fly-fishing, with many fishing enthusiasts making the long trek from Europe and North America.

The Futaleufú River, just west of Trevelin, is a particularly popular spot, and it's known as the 'river of a hundred rivers' thanks to its many branches that flow away from the main river only to rejoin again.

There are all sorts of fishing programs that include a mix of floating and wading in search of Brown, Rainbow and Brook Trout.

Learn about Welsh culture

The Welsh immigrants first arrived on Argentine shores in 1865, and they slowly planted roots across Patagonia.

One such community was Trevelin, where they managed to cultivate the fertile lands, engage in sheep farming, and build a thriving community.

They also built traditional Welsh-style houses and chapels, which can still be seen in the town today.

The Andean Mill Museum is worth a visit to learn more about their history, plus there are Welsh tea houses where you can enjoy some traditional Welsh cake.

Visit Nant Fach Mill

Just 17 kilometres outside of Trevelin, you'll find the Nant Fach Mill, which is a replica of the flour mills that were used in the late nineteenth century.

The name Nant Fach means ‘small creek’ in Welsh, and the mill acts as a museum displaying lots of agricultural machinery.

There's also an indoor component to the museum showcasing tools, furniture, crockery and musical instruments that were brought over from Wales by the early settlers.

Futaleufú Hydroelectric Complex

Trevelin is the access point to the southern part of Los Alerces National Park, where you can visit the Futaleufú Dam.

The dam was built between 1971 and 1976 with the goal of providing electricity to an aluminum plant in the coastal city of Puerto Madryn. 

There are also plenty of hiking trails to enjoy within the park, which lead to rivers, waterfalls and lookout points.

You can get more ideas of things to do in Trevelin here.

Bariloche

Best place in Patagonia for chill city vibes and light adventure.

If you're a city person but you still want to get a taste of Patagonia without doing anything too strenuous (like a multi-day hike!), then Bariloche might be the place for you!

Formally known as San Carlos de Bariloche, this city is the gateway to the Argentine Lake District. It has an incredible craft beer scene, is renowned for its artisanal ice creams and chocolates, plus it offers plenty of light adventures (including some cool historical walks!) so you can still enjoy the beauty of the outdoors.

This is one of the best places to visit in Patagonia for chill city vibes surrounded by epic mountain scenery. Also, here's how to get to Bariloche because there is a cool cross-country train journey to consider!

Best activities in Bariloche

Boat tour of Isla Victoria

The boat tour to Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest is one of the most popular excursions in Bariloche.

The tour departs from Puerto Pañuelo and travels on Lago Nahuel Huapi until you reach the Arrayanes Forest. This is the forest believed to have inspired Disney's Bambi.

The boat tour then continues towards Isla Victoria, where you disembark once more and can either join a guided hike or explore the island at your leisure.

There's a beautiful beach called Playa del Toro, as well as hiking trails, and you can also see some small cave paintings.

Explore the craft beer scene

You could spend two weeks in Bariloche and visit a different brewery every day. There are so many to choose from, and they all offer something different.

Cerveza Patagonia is a classic stop on the Circuito Chico at Km 24.7 for anyone visiting Bariloche. Their brewery has the best views you could ask for - lakes and snowcapped mountains as far as the eye can see. Come for the beers, stay for the views!

Cervecería Gilbert is a rustic brewpub that serves some great beers paired with traditional dishes like wild boar, trout and lentil stew.

You can also check out Cervecería Manush for craft beer and gourmet burgers.

This is but a mere sampling of what's available in Bariloche's beer scene!

Stay at the Llao Llao Hotel

If you want to centre your trip to Bariloche around rest and relaxation in an unbeatable setting, then you need to stay at the Llao Llao Hotel.

This is considered one of the leading hotels in the world, and it's easy to see why.

Its location is unparalleled; the Llao Llao Hotel sits on 15 hectares of land between two lakes - Lago Moreno and Lago Nahuel Huapi. It is framed by the mountain peaks of Cerro Tronador and Cerro Lopez, and it was built in a unique style that drew inspiration from alpine construction and Canadian log cabins.

The hotel features a golf course, marina, infinity pool, spa, fitness centre, and numerous restaurants.

Drive the Circuito Chico

Another must-do activity in Bariloche is to drive the Circuito Chico. This is a scenic drive that follows the lakeshore of Lago Nahuel Huapi heading north, and then loops around various lakes before circling back towards Bariloche.

Along the route, there are numerous lookout points where you can pull over and enjoy the views. Plus, there are microbreweries, restaurants, cafes, hiking trails, kayak rentals and more.

The drive can typically be done in half a day, including stops for food and photos.

Try artisanal ice cream and chocolates

If you have a sweet tooth, you'll enjoy all the artisanal chocolate and ice cream offerings in Patagonia.

Rapa Nui is known for its 'Franui' - we're talking Patagonian raspberries dipped in white chocolate and then milk chocolate. They are delicious! Their main location features a cafe, ice cream shop and ice skating rink.

You have to try the dulce de leche ice cream when in Argentina! The closest thing I can compare it to is caramel, but it's an experience in and of itself.

Another great option is Mamushka. This is a nice place to go for a sweet breakfast or afternoon tea (known as merienda in Argentina). Aside from selling chocolates, they have a nice cafe that serves all sorts of cakes and elaborate sweets.

Península Valdés

Best place in Patagonia for wildlife viewing opportunities.

Península Valdés is one of the best places to visit in coastal Patagonia if you want to see wildlife.

The peninsula is home to Magellanic penguins, sea lions, elephant seals, Southern right whales, dolphins, guanacos, rheas, maras and so much more!

It is also an important nature reserve that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so if you want to experience the best of coastal Patagonia, Península Valdés should be at the top of your list.

Best activities in Península Valdés

Lunch at an estancia

A nice activity to enjoy on Península Valdés is lunch at Estancia San Lorenzo.

This traditional Patagonian sheep ranch raises Australian merino sheep for wool production, and depending on the time of year you visit, you can witness a variety of activities related to sheep farming, like marking, shearing, and herding the sheep with the help of dogs.

The restaurant is set in the old shearing barn, and it serves Patagonian-style dishes in a rustic setting.

Estancia San Lorenzo also happens to be home to the largest Magellanic penguin rookery in the world, which brings us to our next point.

Visit the largest penguin rookery

Estancia San Lorenzo Nature Reserve is located within the Peninsula Valdés Protected Natural Area and can be visited on a day trip from Puerto Madryn.

With an estimated 600,000 penguins per season, it is the largest known continental colony of Magellanic penguins.

Estancia San Lorenzo opens its doors to visitors every year from September 7 to March 31. The opening hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, with guided tours of the rookery offered 4 times per day.

See a geographical accident

On the eastern shore of Península Valdés, you'll find Caleta Valdés, which is best described as a ‘geographic accident’.

The caleta is a long, narrow body of water that has been naturally closed off by a strip of land, with only a small opening connecting it to the sea. It stretches 35 kilometres in length.

This is a good spot to see Magellanic penguins, and depending on the time of year, it also draws elephant seals.

Look for wildlife at Punta Delgada

Another place to visit on the peninsula is Punta Delgada, a beach with steep sandy cliffs that offers some great wildlife viewing opportunities.

Punta Delgada sees a high concentration of elephant seals during mating and moulting season (this is when the seals shed their hair and the upper layer of their skin).

And if you happen to be in the area around lunch time, you can stop at the Punta Delgada Lighthouse. This former post office and military building is now a sheep farm, hotel and restaurant.

Puerto Pirámides

Best place in Patagonia for a hippie beach town getaway.

Puerto Pirámides is the only town on Península Valdés, and aside from the wildlife viewing opportunities that draw visitors to the peninsula, many choose to come specifically for the town's hippie feel and the beach.

Puerto Pirámides is known for its colourful buildings and murals, eco hotels are the accommodation of choice, and people walk around barefoot.

Best activities in Puerto Pirámides

Go on a boat tour

Puerto Pirámides is the departure point for boat tours around the Golfo Nuevo.

Depending on the time of year, you can enjoy whale-watching tours, or watch the sea lions basking in the sunshine along the cliffs in Punta Pirámides.

These tours are also a great opportunity to see all sorts of sea birds - especially cormorants, who are there by the thousands!

Hike the cliffs for sunrise

For a spectacular sunrise you won't soon forget, hike up to the cliffs just east of town. There's a trail that leads up from the port area just behind where the campervans park.

It's steep, but it's a relatively short stretch, and once you reach the to,p you can look out over the Golfo Nuevo, and if you're lucky, you might even spot a whale.

Look for fossils

Another thing to do in Puerto Pirámides is to look for fossils!

If you were to travel back in time millions of years ago, the cliffs you see today would have been the ocean floor. And as the cliffs slowly erode away, marine fossils are revealed.

Fossilized oysters, scallops and sea urchins are quite common, though you can also find shark teeth and fossilized remains of birds and marine mammals.

The coastline just west of town is a good area to see fossils, but remember that removing any is strictly prohibited.

Enjoy the seafood

What do you do when you're staying in a coastal beach town?

You enjoy the seafood, of course!

Our favourite restaurant in town was La Covacha Resto Mar. They have a variety of seafood pastas to choose from, plus scallops gratin, clam chowder, sautéed prawns, calamari, and there's always an experimental dish of the day if your taste buds are feeling adventurous.

Stay at an eco hotel

Because the town of Puerto Pirámides is located in the Península Valdés Natural Protected Area, there are certain regulations as to what can and cannot be built here.

These restrictions have given rise to eco hotels with a focus on sustainability and being environmentally friendly.

We stayed at Océano Patagonia Wild Coast Residence, which is a beachfront property that uses a geothermal heating and cooling system. They also have a water recycling system since this is a desert climate. Plus, they have panels for renewable solar energy.

Las Grutas

Best place in Patagonia for a seaside vacation.

Las Grutas is a resort town located on the Gulf of San Matias on the Patagonian coastline, and it is renowned for its beaches and sea caves, which make it a popular summer destination for those seeking a coastal escape.

A large part of the town is painted white, making it feel slightly reminiscent of a Greek island. The streets are lined with hotels, seafood restaurants, ice cream parlours, and lots of souvenir shops.

This is a destination you'll want to visit during the summer months, because it is seasonal and shuts down at the end of summer.

Best activities in Las Grutas

Enjoy the beaches and sea caves

The best thing to do in Las Grutas is to enjoy some beach time and visit the sea caves.

The sea caves of Las Grutas are ancient geological formations created by the constant erosion of the cliffs by the sea waves. Over time, the water carved out hollow spaces in the rocky cliffs. The caves are quite small and shallow, but it's still a lot of fun to explore the cliffside.

Go snorkelling or scuba diving

If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, two popular activities to enjoy in Las Grutas are snorkelling and scuba diving.

The clear and calm waters of the Gulf of San Matias create the perfect conditions for these activities, making Las Grutas a sought-after destination by both beginners and experienced divers.

Scuba diving operators in Las Grutas offer guided tours and excursions to the best dive sites, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for divers of all skill levels.

Eat at Del Azul

Seafood is the thing to eat when visiting the coastal town of Las Grutas, and one restaurant worth seeking out is Del Azul.

You can enjoy dishes like mixed ceviche, seafood paella, battered prawns, shrimp tagliatelle, and even sushi!

This is a restaurant that we were happy to return to time and time again, and it comes highly recommended.

Go on a 4x4 safari

Another fun activity in the outskirts of Las Grutas is a 4x4 expedition to the salt flats, which is typically combined with a campfire meal.

Salinas de Gualicho are the largest salt flats in Argentina, the second largest in South America, and the third largest in the world.

These salt flats also have the second-lowest elevation in South America, dropping down to -72 metres below sea level. The city of Buenos Aires could fit in this depression more than two times!

Whale watching

In recent years, Las Grutas has introduced whale watching as a tourist activity, taking advantage of the increasing presence of these majestic creatures in the San Matías Gulf.

Each year, Southern right whales return to the Patagonian coasts to breed and nurse their young, seeking warmer waters. While solitary whales are occasionally spotted in the fall, the main spectacle occurs from mid-August to October.

Gaiman

Best place in Patagonia for Welsh culture.

As you'll soon discover on this website, there is no shortage of Welsh towns to visit in Patagonia!

Gaiman may just be the most famous of them all; this is the one Diana, Princess of Wale,s visited during her tour of Argentina.

This town is one of the best places to visit in Patagonia to learn about Welsh immigration and enjoy a Welsh afternoon tea.

Best activities in Gaiman

Have a Welsh afternoon tea

There are numerous Welsh tea houses to visit in Gaiman, however, the best known is Ty Te Caerdydd, since this is the one Lady Diana visited during her trip to Argentina in 1995.

However, no matter which tea house you choose, you can expect to find some bara brith or Welsh cake on the menu.

My one tip is to skip lunch and go hungry because afternoon tea is quite bountiful with sandwiches, scones, cakes and more.

Quintas Narlú

Quintas Narlú is a beautiful farm located on the outskirts of Gaiman on Ruta 7.

They have a shop on site where you can pick up fresh fruits, berries, jams, honey, liqueurs and other traditional souvenirs.

We picked up a few items, and afterwards, the owner let us wander around the farm and the apple orchard, where we enjoyed a picnic.

Visit the local museums

Even though Gaiman is a small place, you could probably spend a good part of the day museum hopping and visiting the historic buildings scattered across town.

You have the Regional History Museum, which is set in the old train station and displays some of the items that were brought over by the early Welsh settlers.

Then you have the Tehuelche-Mapuche Museum, formerly known as the Gaiman Anthropological Museum, housed in one of the first two-story buildings in Gaiman. This one focuses on the friendship between the Tehuelches and the Welsh, and how the former helped the newcomers survive in a new and hostile climate.

You can also tour the first stone house to be built in Gaiman, dating back to 1874. This was the home of David D. Roberts and his wife Jemima Jones, who became the first Welsh settlers of Gaiman.

Central Chubut Railway Tunnel

Another attraction in Gaiman is the old train tunnel, which was part of the Central Chubut Railway.

This was the first railway in Patagonia, and it helped cut down travel times since this journey was previously done on horseback.

Inside the tunnel, there are audiovisual displays that share the history of the railway in Spanish, English and Welsh.

Riverside walk along the Chubut River

Another nice thing to do in Gaiman is to walk along the shores of the Chubut River, which crosses the Province of Chubut.

The river is lined with weeping willows, and there's a nice riverside path you can follow across town.

Trelew

Best place in Patagonia for dinosaur lovers.

Trelew is another city with Welsh roots and its name translates to 'town of Lewis', reflecting its Welsh origins.

But aside from Welsh culture, Trelew is a destination that also offers an extensive collection of dinosaur fossils from across Patagonia, it has links to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and it's also the gateway to a petrified forest, and natural areas where you can visit a vast colony of Magellanic penguins.

Best activities in Trelew

See dinosaurs

The Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum is one of the most important and renowned paleontological museums in South America.

Named after the Italian-Argentine paleontologist Egidio Feruglio, the museum is dedicated to preserving and showcasing the rich paleontological heritage of Patagonia.

The museum's extensive collection contains a vast array of fossils, including dinosaur remains, prehistoric creatures, and ancient plant specimens.

Aside from the museum, you can also visit the biggest dinosaur sculpture in the world! It's located on the outskirts of town, directly across from Trelew Airport.

Have lunch at Hotel Touring Club

Trelew's Hotel Touring Club has a storied history, having welcomed numerous famous guests, including the renowned writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, known for his masterpiece The Little Prince.

Interestingly, the hotel also played host to a notorious gang of bank and train robbers, including the infamous Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and Ethel Place. Fleeing from US law enforcement, they sought refuge in this remote corner of Patagonia before venturing towards the Andes.

Learn about the Welsh settlers

The Regional Museum Pueblo de Luis is housed in the historic former railway station, which dates back to 1889. Within its walls, the museum narrates the history of the Welsh immigrants who embarked on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean, eventually settling in the valley along the Chubut River.

The museum is divided into different rooms, each offering a unique perspective on the region's history. The journey commences with exhibits dedicated to the Mapuches and the Tehuelches who lived in these lands, followed by the early exploration of the area between 1520 and 1865, and then the arrival of Welsh immigrants.

Take a day trip to the petrified forest

There are quite a few day trips you can do from Trelew, one of them being to the Petrified Forest Florentino Ameghino.

The journey there is just under 2 hours, and you'll come face to face with petrified logs that were once part of an extensive forest. These logs were then carried by rivers to the sea coast of that time, and date back to around 60 million years ago.

Visit the nearby penguins

Not too far from Trelew, you also have some great birdwatching opportunities.

Nearby Punta Tombo is home to one of the largest colonies of Magellanic penguins in the world, making it a popular destination for wildlife enthusiasts.

El Calafate

Best place in Patagonia to see glaciers.

El Calafate acts as a gateway to Los Glaciares National Park, renowned for its glaciers, including the magnificent Perito Moreno Glacier.

This colossal ice mass, with its dramatic icefalls and striking blue hues, is a true marvel of nature and draws travellers from around the globe.

The glaciers are the stars of the show, but there's plenty of fun to be had in and around El Calafate.

Best activities in El Calafate

Los Glaciares National Park

Los Glaciares National Park is home to one of the world's most stunning glacial landscapes, and it encompasses 726,927 hectares, making it the largest national park in the country.

The park owes its name to the numerous glaciers that cover roughly half the park, many of which are fed by the massive South Patagonian Ice Field.

Perhaps none is more famous than the Perito Moreno Glacier, which is constantly advancing, creating a mesmerizing spectacle as massive ice chunks calve into Lake Argentino.

The park has boardwalks and viewing decks where you can watch the magic unfold!

Go on a glacier boat tour

If you want to see a lot of glaciers up close and personal, it's worth splurging on tickets for the 'Glaciers Gourmet' tour, which is a full-day boat excursion aboard María Turquesa.

You'll get to see the Upsala, Seco, Heim, Spegazzini and Perito Moreno glaciers. Overwhelming beauty that can move you to tears is the only way to describe what you'll see!

It's an experience you won't soon forget, and it's worth doing even if you've already visited the park. You'll get a completely different perspective. These are some of the best tours from El Calafate to Perito Moreno Glacier to give you some ideas. However, this El Calafate glacier boat tour was our favourite!

Visit the Glaciarium and ice bar

Glaciarium is a museum dedicated to the study and preservation of glaciers, which is located on the outskirts of El Calafate.

As a region renowned for its breathtaking glaciers, the museum serves as an introduction to the fragile ecosystem of these ice giants. Inside Glaciarium, visitors can explore interactive exhibits and multimedia displays that offer valuable insights into glaciology, climate change, and the importance of preserving these natural wonders.

But the main draw is the museum's ice bar, which is located at basement level. Here, guests are given these hooded poncho jackets to stay warm while being served drinks in glasses made entirely of ice. Music blasts in the background, so why not have a little dance?

It's a great activity for an extreme weather day when trekking isn't possible.

Spend the day at an estancia

Visiting a local estancia is part of the Patagonian travel experience, and there are plenty of El Calafate estancias to choose from.

One popular excursion is to Estancia Nibepo Aike, which you can visit on a day trip or stay overnight.

This working estancia is located within Los Glaciares National Park, and it's an opportunity to learn about life on a Patagonian ranch, go horseback riding, watch a sheep-shearing demonstration, and enjoy a traditional Argentine BBQ.

Go on a 4x4 tour

Another popular excursion from El Calafate is up to the Calafate Balconies.

This is a scenic drive in a 4x4 vehicle, which goes up Mount Huyliche to a scenic lookout offering views of Lake Argentino and the Andes Mountains.

Once atop the balconies, you have the options of ziplining, going on a guided hike, or exploring further by 4x4.

You can get more ideas of things to do in El Calafate in this travel guide, plus a list of fun day trips from El Calafate here.

El Chaltén

Best place in Patagonia for trekking and epic mountain ranges.

El Chaltén is often referred to as the trekking capital of Argentina, and it's an adventurer's playground.

Situated within Los Glaciares National Park, this picturesque town is surrounded by mountain peaks, glaciers, and pristine wilderness.

Of course, the real draw to El Chaltén lies in its abundant trails, ranging from easy walks to challenging mountain hikes.

You have the iconic trek to Cerro Fitz Roy with its distinctive granite spires, the epic route to Laguna de los Tres with its turquoise waters, and the trek to Cerro Torre with views of surrounding glaciers.

El Chaltén's raw, rugged beauty is what makes it one of the best places to visit in Patagonia.

Best activities in El Chaltén

Mirador de los Cóndores

If you're looking for an easy hike to ease into all the trekking in El Chaltén, Mirador de los Cóndores is a good place to start.

This easy hike leads up to a lookout point where not only do you get panoramic views of the town, but as the trail's name suggests, you can frequently spot condors flying overhead.

This trail connects with another hike called Mirador de las Águilas, where you guessed it, you can sometimes spot eagles.

Cerro Fitz Roy

Cerro Fitz Roy is a mountain with an elevation of 3,375 meters above sea level, and it is known for its rugged and imposing granite peak, which is one of the most iconic landmarks in Patagonia.

You can view Cerro Fitz Roy from a few different points, including Laguna Capri, or Laguna de los Tres if you're up for a more challenging and intense full-day hike.

Cerro Torre

Cerro Torre stands at an elevation of 3,128 meters above sea level, and it's known for its challenging and technically demanding climbing routes, making it a coveted destination for experienced mountaineers.

Cerro Torre's distinctive spire-like summit is often shrouded in ice and clouds, adding to its magic.

You can view Cerro Torre by hiking to the lookout known as Mirador Cerro Torre, or you can continue further to Laguna Torre, which is the lagoon at the base of the mountain peak.

Rafting Río de las Vueltas

A popular activity for the thrill seeker visiting El Chaltén is a rafting excursion on the Río de las Vueltas, or River of the Turns.

This is a river of glacial origin that is born in Lago del Desierto and then flows into Lake Viedma.

The first part of the river is 6 kilometres of tranquil and meandering waters that allow you to enjoy the scenery and get comfortable with rafting.

The second section is where the river enters the canyon, and there are 10 kilometres of rapids. This is where you get the heart-pumping adventure!

Hotel with a pool or spa

Because El Chaltén is a very active destination where you'll likely spend most of your days hiking, it's a nice idea to book a hotel with pool or a spa where you can unwind at the end of a busy day. Your muscles will thank you for the soak!

You may also need a full recovery day after tackling some of the longer and more challenging treks, so a comfortable and spacious hotel room is worth it.

Or if you're looking for a truly memorable one-of-a-kind stay in El Chalten, consider some of the luxury camps with geo domes just outside of town. You're guaranteed epic mountain views and nothing but tranquillity.

Ushuaia

Best place in Patagonia for a sense of accomplishment.

Getting to Ushuaia is a feat in and of itself! It's not every day you can say you've set foot in the southernmost city in the world.

Maybe you're wrapping up an epic trip across Patagonia, maybe you're about to board a cruise to Antarctica, or maybe you just wanted to go on some fun action-packed tours in Ushuaia to experience the city.

Ushuaia is one of the most epic places to visit in Patagonia simply because of the effort it takes to get there!

Best activities in Ushuaia

Train to the End of the World

The Southern Fuegian Railway, better known as the End of the World Train, is a steam railway located in Argentina’s Tierra del Fuego province.

Originally built as a means to transport timber by the prisoners in the Ushuaia penal colony, the narrow-gauge railway was initially known as the Train of Prisoners.

Today, it has been transformed into a heritage train, maintaining its status as the southernmost railway in the world.

For visitors to Ushuaia, this experience is a must-do activity, particularly for train enthusiasts, as it offers a unique glimpse into the region's history and the scenic beauty of Patagonia.

Tierra del Fuego National Park

Tierra del Fuego National Park is Argentina's southernmost park, and it's made up of Andean forest, Magellanic forest and pre-Antarctic forest.

The park features a variety of trails that range from easy 1-kilometre loops to more challenging multi-day treks.

One thing is for sure, you'll be treated to epic landscapes and ever-changing weather, which may include sunshine, drizzle, fog and snow, sometimes all in one day!

Beagle Channel Cruise

Another must-do activity when visiting Ushuaia is a cruise on the Beagle Channel, which separates Argentina's Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from Chile's Navarino Island.

The channel is named after the HMS Beagle, the ship on which the first survey of this area was conducted.

A Beagle Channel cruise is a great opportunity to view the local wildlife, which includes sea lions, seals, Magellanic penguins, cormorants, and if you're lucky, even Peale's dolphins and minke whales.

Plus, you get to see the famous Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse, sometimes confused with the 'Lighthouse at the End of the World'.

Helicopter Flight

Another memorable activity you can enjoy in Ushuaia is a helicopter flight at the end of the world!

The most popular and budget-friendly option is a 7-minute flight over the city center, the Maritime Museum and the former Prison of Ushuaia, as well as the Martial Glacier.

Longer flights will take you even further to the Emerald Lagoon, the Carbajal Valley, and Mount Olivia.

If you're interested, you can read more about how to choose the right Ushuaia helicopter tour for you.

Sample local Fuegian cuisine

For all the foodies out there, when you reach Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost province in Argentina, you have to try the local Fuegian cuisine, which combines food products from the forest, river and sea.

This destination is best known for King crab, known locally as centolla, which features in many restaurant menus. You can get in pastas, stews, or even served as the main dish.

Fuegian lamb is another food to try. It's typically cooked on the cross and makes an appearance in BBQ restaurants.

Lastly, keep an eye out for desserts featuring calafate berries, which only grow in southern Patagonia.

You can get some ideas of things to do in Ushuaia and where to stay in Ushuaia here. Plus, this blog post is loaded with helpful tips for your time in Ushuaia.

Tolhuin

Best place in Patagonia for unwinding at the end of the world.

Tolhuin is a tranquil lakeside town set on the shores of Lago Fagnano in the province of Tierra del Fuego, and it's a nice contrast after spending a few days in the southernmost city of Ushuaia.

This is one of the best places in Patagonia for those looking to go off-the-beaten-path - not only is Tolhuin at the bottom of the world, but you also have to cross the highest mountain pass across Argentina's National Route 3.

Getting there requires a bit of effort, but once you arrive, you can relax and soak in the tranquillity of the place.

Best activities in Tolhuin

Book a lakeside cottage

Since one of the main draws to Tolhuin is rest and relaxation out in nature, you should consider booking some lakeside accommodations.

We really enjoyed Hostería Kaiken, a beautiful guesthouse set atop a cliff overlooking Lago Fagnano.

It's in the outskirts of town, but we enjoyed the lakeside strolls and the onsite restaurant had some fabulous gourmet meals.

Kayaking on Lago Fagnano

Lago Fagnano is a lake shared by both Argentina and Chile, and it's one of the main draws to Tolhuin.

The lake is of glacial origin and runs east to west, stretching 98 kilometres in length, 72.5 km of which sit on the Argentine side of the border.

On a calm day, you can go kayaking on the lake, but just like anywhere in Patagonia, you never know what you're going to get. One day the waters could be as calm as a mirror, and the next look like a tempestuous ocean!

Hiking

Laguna Negra Provincial Reserve is a nature reserve that sits on the northeast end of Lago Fagnano.

The hiking trail follows the lake’s shoreline, crosses southern Fuegian forest, goes through peat bogs, and continues past the ‘black lagoon’ where it ends shortly thereafter.

This is one of the many hikes that visitors can enjoy in the area.

Bakery

If there's one place you need to eat at during your stay in Tolhuin, it's Panadería La Union.

This is a very famous bakery that is well-frequented by locals who use it as a gathering place, as well as travellers making the bus journey from Rio Gallegos to Ushuaia.

Not only can you get some delicious breads and pastries here, but they also sell empanadas and artisanal chocolate.

4x4 lakeside excursion

One of the most popular tours in the area is a full-day 4x4 adventure across the Garibaldi Pass, which is the highest point on Argentina's Ruta Nacional 3 and the only paved route across the Fuegian Andes.

From the pass, travellers get to admire the picturesque Lago Escondido, meaning 'hidden lake,' before embarking on an off-roading adventure along the lake's edge and through the forest, eventually reaching Lago Fagnano.

The tour concludes with a traditional Argentine asado, featuring choripán, bife de chorizo, salad, Malbec wine, and cheese.

While the actual town of Tolhuin isn't visited, this excursion offers a glimpse of the region's main attractions and a delightful taste of Argentine hospitality with a delicious meal.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,f99c3745b4b2cdfb2fc9761215f0ac8b6f51d01e

Buenos Aires is a city that thrives in all seasons, even when the skies turn grey. Having spent many rainy days exploring the Argentine capital, I’ve discovered that some of its most memorable experiences happen indoors, away from the umbrella-toting crowds.

From historic palaces and grand theatres to cozy cafés and world-class museums, Buenos Aires offers endless ways to connect with its culture, architecture, and history, no matter the weather.

In this guide, I’ll share 15 of the best rainy day activities in Buenos Aires, like touring palaces, lingering in bares notables, taking a cooking class, exploring art galleries, shopping for leather goods, browsing beautiful bookstores, and so much more.

Things to do in Buenos Aires on a Rainy Day

1. Explore Palacio Barolo's architecture

A fun rainy day activity in Buenos Aires is to join a guided visit of Palacio Barolo. Not only does this 100-metre-tall building offer panoramic views of the whole city, but its design was inspired by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. That means visiting this building is an architectural journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.

Hell and Purgatory can be reached by elevator, however, to reach Heaven, you have to climb a spiralling staircase for the last 8 floors. The reward is the glass lighthouse atop Palacio Barolo, which offers 360-degree views of the whole city. It's truly spectacular, and I think it's something that you can enjoy rain or shine.

As a bonus, you may want to tack on a visit to Salon 1923, a rooftop bar located inside Palacio Barolo. The east and west-facing terraces may be closed because of the rain, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the indoor space in all its 1920s glory.

We had walked past Palacio Barolo in Monserrat so many times on our countless visits to Buenos Aires, and I can't believe it took us so long to finally visit! It's a really fun tour and a great way to explore an iconic landmark in the city.

You can book your guided tour of Palacio Barolo here. Tours are bilingual (English and Spanish) and run 1.5 hours in length.

2. Take an Argentine cooking class

I'm a big fan of taking cooking classes whenever I travel. In part, because I love to eat, but also, what makes for a better souvenir than learning to make a recipe and taking it back home with you?

There are loads of Argentine cooking classes to choose from in Buenos Aires; you can learn to make empanadas, alfajores, or even multi-course meals. 

This Pachamama cooking class is a particularly popular one, and it's a feast where you get to prepare a four-course local menu while learning about the history and origin of these traditional Argentine dishes.

You'll be welcomed with a picada (a snacking spread) and a vermouth cocktail because you can't get to work in the kitchen if you're feeling hungry. 

Then, you dive into the different recipes, including chipá, a starchy bread with Guaraní roots; empanadas, dough pastries typically stuffed with meat; humita, an Andean corn dish that can be served in a corn husk or in a casserole; and dulce de leche crepes. All of this paired with wine!

You can book your Pachamama Argentine cooking class here. This class runs 3.5 hours and is consistently rated as a 5-star cooking experience by visitors.

3. Go to a tango and dinner show

Going to a tango show is a quintessential part of any trip to Buenos Aires. This is the birthplace of tango, so of course you need to make time to go to at least one show!

Here's a list of some of the best tango shows in Buenos Aires, with each one offering something a little bit different. There are tango shows that include folklore dancing, shows that have more of a cabaret style, and big stage productions with a Broadway flair.

Whenever I have friends or family visiting Argentina, this is one of the first activities I recommend. It's just a really fun introduction to Argentine culture!

4. Tour the National Congress of Argentina

Another thing to do in Buenos Aires when it rains is to join a guided visit of the National Congress of Argentina.

The National Congress is composed of the Senate with 72 seats and the Chamber of Deputies with 257 seats. This means it is bicameral and its ordinary sessions run from March 1 to November 30.

The building itself is spectacular both inside and outside. The guided visit ran 1 hour in length and we got to visit both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, as well as numerous salons. We were divided into 2 groups: one with an English-speaking guide and another with a Spanish-speaking guide.

It was a super informative visit and we lucked out with an amazing guide who shared a wealth of information, answered all our questions, and shared plenty of fun facts along the way. The hour flew by!

Visiting the Argentine National Congress does take a bit of luck. In theory, guided tours run Monday to Friday at 12:00 and 17:00. However, in practice, these tours can be cancelled at the very last minute if there is parliamentary activity. 

We tried visiting a few times during our many visits to Buenos Aires, and it took us a couple of attempts before our dates aligned with the guided visits.

I would recommend checking the official Senate website on the day of your visit. Scroll down to Agenda de Actividades (Activities Agenda) on the homepage and check if there's a listed Visita guiada al Palacio Legislativo (Guided visit of the Legislative Palace) for your desired date. 

You'll then want to make your way to Hipólito Yrigoyen 1863 (the third door on the south entrance of the National Congress) and arrive 30 minutes before the tour, as they accept a maximum of 30 people on this guided visit. You cannot reserve ahead of time.

To take part in this visit, you'll have to present your ID (either a passport or DNI), have your photo taken, and go through security. 

5. Visit Teatro Colón

Another iconic Buenos Aires attraction I'd recommend visiting during your time in the city is Teatro Colon. This is a great rainy day activity as you'll be indoors.

Teatro Colón is an opera house that overlooks Avenida de Julio and first opened its doors in 1908. Opulent is one way to describe this building; it truly feels like you're walking through a French palace!

Many of the materials were brought over from Europe, including different types of Italian marble, French stained glass, and Venetian mosaics.

The auditorium is shaped like a horseshoe with seven tiers that hold 2,487 velvet seats and standing room for 1,000. It's the kind of building that will take your breath away!

While Teatro Colon is an architectural work of art, what sets it apart is its acoustics! The opera has continuously been listed as having some of the best acoustics for operas and concerts.

The great Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti once said, ""The acoustics have the greatest defect: they are perfect! Imagine what this signifies for the singer: if one sings something bad, one notices immediately.”

If a guided visit of Teatro Colon is not enough (you may very well want to come back for a performance after seeing its beauty!), you can check out their program, including ballet, opera, philharmonic orchestra, and many other concerts.

Lastly, if you're feeling a bit peckish after your visit, I recommend walking one block over to Petit Colón. This is one of my favourite historic cafes in Buenos Aires and I go at least once whenever I'm in the city.

6. Visit Casa Rosada

Casa Rosada, or the Pink House, is the executive mansion and office of the President of Argentina. Also known as the Government House or Casa de Gobierno, this building sits on the east end of the Plaza de Mayo.

The Casa Rosada is known for its Italianate architecture and unique pink colour. “Why pink?”, you might ask.

Well, the building’s hue is a combination of red and white, representing the colours of the opposing political factions in 19th-century Argentina; the Federals used red while the Unitarians used white.

Another explanation you might hear is that at one point, the Pink House was painted with cows’ blood, a supposed alternative to paint that wouldn’t peel in the humidity!

The interior of the Casa Rosada features grand halls, beautiful staircases, and historic rooms like the Salón de los Bustos, where busts of former presidents are displayed.

The building also has a stunning courtyard known as the Patio de las Palmeras, filled with palm trees and statues.

Aside from touring Casa Rosada, you can also visit Museo Casa Rosada, a museum located underneath the presidential palace. It covers more than 200 years of Argentine history from the May Revolution of 1810 to the present day.

I ended up visiting this museum on a rainy day in Buenos Aires, having walked past the Casa Rosada countless times! The museum holds presidential cars, portraits and documents. Plus, the building itself is a time capsule where you can see the old brick walls of the original fort and customs building.

Note: Casa Rosada is not currently open to visitors (only guided school visits). When it does re-open to the general public, you’ll be able to click through Visitas Casa Rosada. They typically offer free guided tours in both English and Spanish. You will need your passport to enter.

7. Marvel at Argentine Palaces

Buenos Aires is often called the “Paris of South America,” and nowhere is this more evident than in its collection of elegant palaces and grand mansions built during the city’s Belle Époque, during the late 19th to early 20th century.

During this period, Argentina’s elite, enriched by booming agricultural exports, sought to display their wealth by commissioning European architects and importing materials from France and Italy to construct opulent urban residences.

Many of these palaces line the avenues of Recoleta, Retiro, and Palermo, showcasing ornate façades, wrought-iron balconies, marble staircases, and sprawling ballrooms inspired by Parisian and Neoclassical styles.

While some have been transformed into embassies, cultural centers, or luxury hotels, others remain private family homes, lending an air of grandeur to everyday city streets.

Over the years, I've been able to visit a few of these Argentine palaces, like Palacio de Aguas Corrientes, which houses the Water Works Museum; Palacio Paz, which is home to the National Arms Museum; and Palacio Alvear, where I've had afternoon tea.

Pick a few palaces to visit, and you have a great Buenos Aires rainy day activity.

8. Zanjon de los Granados

El Zanjón de los Granados is one of Buenos Aires’ most fascinating hidden treasures, offering a journey beneath the city streets into layers of urban history.

Located in San Telmo, this site was uncovered in the 1980s when a local family began restoring a dilapidated 19th-century mansion and accidentally discovered a network of brick tunnels, cisterns, and foundations dating back to the early colonial period.

The tunnels once carried the Zanjón stream, one of the city’s earliest watercourses, before being enclosed and built over as Buenos Aires expanded. 

Today, guided tours take visitors through the subterranean passageways, revealing archaeological remnants, restored architecture, and exhibits that trace the city's evolution from the 1500s onward.

It’s an excellent rainy day activity because the experience is indoors, combining shelter with a deep dive into one of Buenos Aires’ lesser-known attractions.

9. Visit the Bares Notables

Ducking into one of the city’s bares notables, or notable bars, is another great rainy day activity in Buenos Aires.

The city government has officially recognized these historic cafés, bars, and bistros for their cultural, architectural, or historical significance. Many date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Buenos Aires was flourishing as a cosmopolitan hub and European immigrants shaped its café culture. 

Think high ceilings, marble-topped tables, wooden counters, vintage mirrors, and the lingering atmosphere of literary gatherings and political debates. 

Visiting a bar notable isn’t just about grabbing a coffee, but rather about soaking up a piece of porteño history. You can expect a relaxed, old-world ambiance, attentive service, and some even have live music and tango performances in the evenings.

Some of the most famous examples include Café Tortoni, Bar El Federal, and Los 36 Billares, each with its own unique story and character.

10. Shop at Galerias Pacifico

Galerias Pacifico is a historic shopping arcade that was designed in the French Beaux Arts style. It takes up an entire city block, and it is strikingly beautiful!

It was built in 1889 to house the Au Bon Marché department store, however, it never served its original purpose. Instead, it housed the Museo de Bellas Artes up until 1940. Then, in 1992, it became a shopping centre with lots of international brands as well as a food court.

But don't dismiss this shopping centre, even if you don't enjoy shopping! I'm not a huge shopper, but even I take the opportunity to walk through the galleries whenever I'm in the area. 

Galerias Pacifico is more like a museum or an art gallery than a shopping centre, and it will immediately transport you to Paris. The crowning jewel is the central dome featuring hand-painted frescoes that depict a scene called Love or Germination of the Earth.

11. Enjoy the city's many Art Galleries

If you're looking for artsy things to do in Buenos Aires when it rains, then why not check out some of the city's art galleries?

There are countless galleries to choose from for all tastes, but for the purpose of this article, I'm highlighting just 5 of the more famous ones. 

MALBA (Museum of Latin American Art) - MALBA stands for Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, and it's an art museum located in Palermo. It showcases Latin American art from the 20th century to the present.

MAMBA (Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art) - MAMBA is the Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires, and it is located in the district of San Telmo in an industrial brick building. This art museum features over 7000 works by Argentine and international artists like Salvador Dalí, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso.

MACBA (Buenos Aires Museum of Contemporary Art) - MACBA is locally known as Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Buenos Aires. This art museum is located in San Telmo, and it houses works of contemporary art from the 1980s onwards by both local and international artists.

Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes - The Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes is located in the neighbourhood of Recoleta. The museum's permanent collection has works by art greats like El Greco, Goya and Rembrandt, just to name a few. Plus, it has the biggest collection of Argentine art.

National Museum of Decorative Art - This museum is set in a Neoclassical mansion that was designed by a French architect. It was once the home of two prominent figures of Argentine high society at the turn of the century. Today, this mansion-turned-museum houses an impressive collection of European and oriental decorative art ranging from the 14th to the 20th century. This includes furniture, tapestries, sculptures and more.

12. Spend the day Museum-hopping

Aside from art galleries, museums are another classic rainy day activity, even more so in Buenos Aires!

History lovers can dive into Argentina’s political and social past at the Museo Histórico Nacional, housed in a colonial mansion in San Telmo, where exhibits trace the country’s journey from independence to nationhood. We specifically visited this museum during one of our trips to Buenos Aires, so that my dad could see the Curved Sabre of San Martín, who was the liberator of Argentina, Chile and Peru.

Tucked away in the Abasto neighbourhood, the Museo Casa Carlos Gardel offers a glimpse into the life of Carlos Gardel, Argentina’s most iconic tango singer. The museum is housed in the very home where Gardel lived with his mother before his rise to fame. Inside, visitors can explore personal artifacts, original photographs, vintage records, and film posters.

Lastly, one of my favourite museums has recently been the Museo de Armas de La Nación. Housed within the Circulo Militar, a grand Beaux-Arts palace once belonging to the Paz family, the museum holds one of the most impressive weapons collections in South America. When we first walked in, I was surprised to see medieval suits of armour and swords from across Europe! We then moved on to galleries filled with firearms, cannons, uniforms and other Argentine military relics. Once again, this is another one of those museums that I had walked past countless times! I visited on a whim because my dad was interested in seeing it, and it proved to be a hidden gem.

13. Shop for leather goods

Another fun way to spend a rainy day in Buenos Aires is to go shopping for leather goods. Argentina is world-renowned for its high-quality leather with countless boutiques selling leather jackets, leather handbags, leather shoes and more. 

Calle Florida has the highest concentration of leather stores in Buenos Aires, so that's a good place to start and get an idea of styles, prices, and what's on the market.

Calle Florida is a pedestrian street (so you'll want to bring an umbrella if you choose to shop on a rainy day!), however, there are also lots of shopping galleries (so you will be undercover as you explore some sections). 

This street was where I bought my first-ever Argentine leather jacket as a young twenty-something-year-old. It was a bomber-style jacket in tan, and I still have it to this day. So why not go for a fashionable Argentine souvenir that will get plenty of use?

14. Browse books at El Ateneo Grand Splendid

Buenos Aires is a city of bookstores and none is more impressive than El Ateneo Grand Splendid. In fact, just a few years ago, this bookstore was voted the most beautiful in the world!

The bookstore is set in a former theatre, which opened in 1919 as Teatro Gran Splendid. Back then, the theatre had a seating capacity of 1,050 guests and its stage was graced by world-famous tango singers, including the one and only Carlos Gardel.

There are plenty of bookstores in Buenos Aires to visit, but part of the appeal at El Ateneo Grand Splendid is that it still very much looks like a theatre, complete with hand-painted ceiling frescoes, ornate balconies with cozy seating, and some 120,000 books to browse.

You can search through stacks of books, and if you're looking for a Classic Argentine author, you cannot go wrong with Jorge Luis Borges. 

So all in all, a perfect rainy day activity in Buenos Aires, where you can easily spend a few hours.

15. Catch a play on Avenida Corrientes

Maybe you're looking for things to do in Buenos Aires on a rainy evening? We've got you covered there, too!

Avenida Corrientes is known as the 'street that never sleeps'. This avenue is lined with theatres, pizzerias, cafes, bars and restaurants. 

Picture giant billboards, neon signs and plenty of flashing lights. It's an assault on the senses, but it also presents plenty of options! So why not go to a show?

Some of the more famous theatres along Avenida Corrientes include Lola Membrives, Nacional, Astral, Complejo Teatral La Plaza, Metropolitan and Ópera.

In terms of performances, you can catch comedies, musicals, stand-ups, dramas, tango shows and even children's programming.

The one catch is that you'll need to know a bit of Spanish if you want to truly follow the performance.

So there you have it, 15 things to do in Buenos Aires on a rainy day! As you can see, rainy days don’t have to put a damper on your adventures. In fact, they offer the perfect excuse to slow down and discover a more intimate and atmospheric side of the city. 

From wandering through historic cafés and opulent palaces to delving into underground tunnels and museums, there are plenty of ways to stay dry while soaking up local culture. Whether you choose to take an Argentine cooking class, go to a tango show, or browse bookstores, you’ll come away with a deeper appreciation for Buenos Aires’ rich past and vibrant present. 

So pack an umbrella, embrace the moody skies, and let the city’s indoor treasures inspire you!

f2e0e4c9000fb3bc16fb636efa2299911eaea6c3,che_argentina_travel,en,2 Days in Bariloche Itinerary,"Here's how to spend 2 days in Bariloche. This itinerary is the perfect weekend introduction to the city!

What can you do with 2 days in Bariloche? We've crafted an action-packed travel itinerary that includes some city highlights, a scenic road trip, and an island boat excursion, so you can get a taste of Bariloche in 48 hours. 

Bariloche, officially known as San Carlos de Bariloche, is a beautiful city set on the shores of Lago Nahuel Huapi and it is known for its alpine-style architecture and stunning natural surroundings. 

The best way to experience Bariloche is to spend as much time outdoors as possible enjoying the mountain views, kayaking the lakes, and dining at the local brewpubs. 

I've been to Bariloche many times (this is the gateway to northern Patagonia and I'm kind of obsessed with this corner of Argentina!), so I've hand-picked what I think are some of the most iconic experiences this destination has to offer. 

So if you're thinking of visiting over a weekend, this 2-day Bariloche travel guide is just what you need! 

2 Days in Bariloche Itinerary

So you've just flown into Bariloche from Buenos Aires and you want to hit the ground running! My tip would be to arrive the night before and choose a centrally-located hotel, so you can start your exploration bright and early. 

Day 1 in Bariloche

Morning

Breakfast at Rapa Nui

Start the morning with breakfast at Rapa Nui. This is a famous chocolate shop, ice cream parlour and cafe that also features a skating rink. Yes, that's a lot under one roof but it's an iconic spot and the cafe has a beautiful art nouveau interior with colourful stained glass windows.

You probably won't want to start the morning off with chocolate and ice cream (though you can since you're on vacation), but rest assured that you can find normal breakfast items.

For a local breakfast, try ordering a classic café con leche y medialunas - that's coffee with milk and sweet croissants.

They also offer a continental breakfast, plus you can order an assortment of teas, fresh-squeezed juices, smoothies, sandwiches, cakes and more. 

Explore downtown Bariloche on foot

Spend your first morning exploring the downtown area on foot - you can even join a Bariloche walking tour if you want to dive into the local history. 

Centro Cívico is the heart of Bariloche, so this is the place to start. Here you'll find the main square and town hall featuring the alpine-style architecture this part of Patagonia is known for. 

You can visit the Patagonia Museum, which traces the natural & cultural history of Patagonia with a range of dioramas & artifacts. Or you can browse Calle Mitre, which is lined with shops and sometimes turns into a pedestrian street.

Midday

Quick Lunch at El Garage Food Court

Today's lunch is going to be a quick bite since you have a boat to catch! I would suggest an early lunch at El Garage, a food court featuring a variety of food trucks that opens at 11:30 am.

You have lots of options to choose from including hamburgers, pizzas, pastas, gourmet sandwiches, shawarmas and more. 

Afternoon

Isla Victoria Boat Tour

Isla Victoria is an island located in Nahuel Huapi Lake within Nahuel Huapi National Park and it's one of the most popular day trips from Bariloche. 

The island is characterized by a diverse landscape that includes lush forests, rocky cliffs, and sandy beaches, so a boat trip is the perfect way to enjoy it!

The boat tour to Isla Victoria also makes a stop at the Arrayanes Forest, located on the Quetrihué Peninsula. This forest is known for its rare and beautiful cinnamon-coloured Arrayanes trees. The landscapes of the Arrayanes Forest are said to have inspired Disney's Bambi.

If you choose to book your boat tour to Isla Victoria independently, you'll need to make your own way to Puerto Pañuelo, the port the boat tour departs from. You can catch bus Bus #20 which takes about 1 hour, or take a taxi. You'll then purchase your tickets at Cau Cau, though if you're visiting during high season, I would recommend buying them online in advance since this is a very popular trip!

Alternatively, you can book an Isla Victoria and Arrayanes Forest boat tour, and select the option that includes hotel pick-up and drop-off. It does cost a bit more, but it's a hassle-free option if you don't feel too confident in your Spanish language skills.

Tip: Aside from the cost of the boat tour, once you arrive in Puerto Pañuelo, you'll need cash to pay for the National Park entrance fee and the boarding fee. You need to pay this small fee whether you go with a tour or independently.

Evening

Have dinner in town

You'll be back in town right in time for dinner. If you're in the mood to try a brewpub, I would recommend Cerveza Manush at their Centro location. Their food and beers are amazing, plus they open early (most Argentine restaurants don't open for dinner until 8:00 pm!)

The hamburgers here are fabulous. Their Manush Burger features two patties, beer-caramelized onions, double cheddar, aioli and lettuce on a brioche bun. It also comes with a side of fries. 

Aside from burgers, you can get gourmet salads, pizzas, and a variety of traditional Argentine dishes.

Day 2 in Bariloche

Morning

Have breakfast at your hotel

We'll keep things easy and start the morning with breakfast at your hotel because today you're going on a road trip! 

Drive Circuito Chico and enjoy the views from Cerro Campanario

Circuito Chico is one of the most popular and scenic day tours from Bariloche and it's a short enough route that you can do it in half a day.

The name Circuito Chico translates to 'Short Circuit' and it's a 60-kilometre (37-mile) loop that can be traversed by car, bicycle, bus or as part of a guided tour.

The journey starts in the center of Bariloche and you'll take Avenida Exequiel Bustillo to leave the city. This road winds through some of the most picturesque parts of the region, including dense forests, turquoise lakes, and snow-capped mountains. 

As you leave the city, you'll go past Cerro Campanario, a hill that offers some of the most beautiful panoramic views of the region. 

You can hike to the top (if you're visiting independently), which is what I did, but it's not an amazing hike, so save your legs and take the chairlift to the top. 

The views from the peak are where Cerro Campanario really shines! In fact, National Geographic voted Cerro Campanario one of the best panoramic views in the world. 

There are numerous balconies at the top offering 360-degree views. From Cerro Campanario you can see the Nahuel Huapi Lake, Moreno Lake, El Trébol Lagoon, San Pedro Peninsula, Isla Victoria, Cerro Otto, Cerro López, Cerro Goye, Cerro Bellavista, Cerro Catedral and the Llao Llao Hotel.

As you drive the Circuito Chico, you'll come across various panoramic points where you'll definitely want to pull over and take pictures, you'll go past breweries, cute little villages and even the iconic Llao Llao Hotel. 

Colonia Suiza, a small Swiss-style village, is a short detour off this route, so you can easily tack it on if you're driving a rental vehicle. And if you're up for a hike, you can consider Cerro Llao Llao via Villa Tacul, which is 5.6-km out-and-back and takes just under 2 hours to complete.

The beauty of driving the Circuito Chico is in the landscapes and the possibilities along the way, so enjoy the journey. 

This 4-hour Circuito Chico tour stops at Cerro Campanario and at Punto Panoramico for views of the Llao Llao peninsula. 

Midday

Have lunch at a local brewery

Since you'll be spending the morning on the Circuito Chico, I would recommend having lunch at one of the local breweries. 

If this is your first time visiting Bariloche, I would suggest going to Cervecería Patagonia. This is Patagonia's most famous brewery and they have a beautiful location overlooking Lago Moreno. The views are postcard-perfect and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy the scenery.

Alternatively, if you're looking for something a little more low-key and with fewer crowds, my personal favourite is Cervecería Gilbert. This little brewery and restaurant serves up traditional Patagonian dishes featuring wild boar and trout, or lentil and pumpkin dishes if you're vegetarian. Cervecería Gilbert doesn't have the views, but it looks like a little storybook house in the forest.

Afternoon

Kayaking on Lake Moreno

You may as well spend the whole day soaking in the beauty of Bariloche's Circuito Chico, so for your afternoon activity consider a kayaking trip on Lake Moreno. 

Morenito Kayak offers kayak and standup paddle board rentals and they are located on Playa del Moreno Sin Viento. 'Sin viento' means 'without wind' and this is very important in Patagonia! Thankfully, this beach is shielded from the wind, so you can generally expect calmer waters than elsewhere. 

You can rent kayaks and SUPs by the hour, or if you prefer, you can arrange a guided kayaking tour ahead of time. 

Evening

Dinner at the Llao Llao Hotel

End your final day with a fancy dinner at the Llao Llao Hotel - one of the most luxurious hotels in Bariloche, Argentina.

There are several bars and restaurants to choose from at this hotel, but I would recommend Restaurante Patagonia. This restaurant looks like you're inside a log cabin and it has a super warm and cozy feel. 

We opted for fondue when we had dinner there and it was a really fun meal. 

You can even go down to the cava or cellar to select your own bottle of wine.

Where to go after Bariloche

Maybe you only have 2 days in Bariloche because you're planning a bigger northern Patagonia road trip. If that's the case, here are some towns to consider adding to your itinerary. 

Villa La Angostura: This town is nicknamed ‘the Garden of Patagonia’. It has two beautiful bays, tea houses galore, and you can also take a boat ride out to the Arrayanes Forest and hike back. 

San Martín de Los Andes: This is one of the starting points of the Seven Lakes Route. You can also enjoy a boat ride on Lake Lacar, hike the local trails, and visit the town's many chocolate shops. 

El Bolsón: This hippie town is carved between two mountain ranges. You can visit the Sculpture Forest, shop at the hippie fair for traditional Argentine souvenirs, and hike Cerro Piltriquitrón which means ‘hanging from the clouds’.

Lago Puelo: This lakeside town is set next to Lago Puelo National Park. This destination is all about hiking and going on boat trips. 

Esquel: This mountain town is home to the Old Patagonian Express train also known as La Trochita. You can kayak Laguna La Zeta or hike up to Cerro La Cruz for town views. 

Travel tips for 2 days in Bariloche

Be flexible with your schedule. The weather in Patagonia can be quite unpredictable - even in northern Patagonia! - so it's always a good idea to check the forecast and rearrange activities if need be. If the winds are out of control, swap your outdoor activities for a visit to Museo del Chocolate Havanna, an afternoon tea at Mamuschka or some indoor ice skating at Rapa Nui. 

Dress in layers. Because the weather in Patagonia is everchanging and you'll be exploring the mountains, it's best to dress in layers. You might be okay in a t-shirt at noon when you're standing next to the lake, but you'll probably want a fleece and a windbreaker when you're enjoying the views on a mountaintop. 

Rent a car for greater flexibility. If you feel up to driving in Argentina, you may want to rent a car at the airport and use it to explore Bariloche and the surrounding area. This will give you greater mobility than taking the bus or joining a tour. However, keep in mind that most cars in Argentina are manual, so if you can only drive automatic, you'll need to reserve in advance as these vehicles are few and far between.

Be mindful of restaurant hours. Most restaurants in Argentina close in the afternoon and open quite late for dinner. If you really want to eat at a particular spot, be sure to check their hours of operation, because you can't randomly show up for a late lunch. 

Save some attractions for next time! It's hard to pack all the highlights into 2 days in Bariloche, so don't fret and save some things for your next visit. Bariloche is a year-round destination so you can come back in any season and still have a great time.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,1644e210e235646daf9c249f46b8d56f60064e44

So you're travelling around Patagonia and you have 2 days in El Calafate in Santa Cruz Province. Where should you go and what should you do? 

Two days isn't a whole lot of time to do it all, but it is enough to enjoy the main attractions. Namely, visit Los Glaciares National Park, see the Perito Moreno Glacier, and perhaps even visit an estancia. 

I've spent a lot of time in Patagonia and more time in El Calafate than the average traveller. That means I've done a lot of the tours, gone on different day trips and visited the various attractions, so I know which ones are worth doing and which ones can be skipped. 

With this in mind, I've created a 2 day itinerary for El Calafate, that I think includes the best this destination has to offer. 

Here's my 2-day El Calafate itinerary for those who are short on time but want to experience the highlights!

How to spend 2 Days in El Calafate

For starters, if you only have 2 days in El Calafate, you'll want to make the most of your time there! You'll probably be flying in from Buenos Aires and I recommend arriving the night before and going straight to your hotel to get a good night's sleep. 

We're going to spend the first day exploring Los Glaciares National Park and seeing the glaciers up close, but it's important to note that almost all tours to the glaciers depart early in the morning. You must arrive the day before if you want to join a tour!

In this itinerary, I'll also provide you with a few different options when it comes to activities so you can choose according to your interests and your budget. 

Day 1 in El Calafate

Morning

Depart for Los Glaciares National Park

Today is all about the glaciers and that means spending the day in Los Glaciares National Park! 

Los Glaciares National Park is the largest national park in Argentina covering an area of 7,296 square kilometers. This national park is one of Patagonia's gems with ice fields, glaciers, jagged mountain peaks, glacial lakes, crystalline rivers and lush forests. 

While Los Glaciares National Park is home to numerous glaciers, none is more famous than the Perito Moreno Glacier. This is one of the few advancing glaciers in the world and it reaches a height of up to 60 meters above the water level of Lago Argentino. It's a bucket list destination in South America and truly a sight to behold!

There are a few different ways to experience Los Glaciares National Park so I'm going to share 3 different options.

Option 1: Glaciers Boat Tour

The first option is to join a full-day glacier boat tour to visit all the different glaciers in Los Glaciares National Park.

We did this tour aboard Maria Turquesa and it was hands down our favourite experience of the entire trip to El Calafate. 

We spent the day cruising the milky turquoise waters of Lago Argentino and we so many different glaciers along the way: Seco Glacier, Heim Glacier, Spegazzini Glacier, Upsala Glacier, Bertacchi Glacier, and the one and only Perito Moreno Glacier!

We saw icebergs and even fished some pieces out of the water to eat, we went on a guided hike through Puesto de Las Vacas, but we mostly spent the day out on the deck giddy with excitement each time we approached a new glacier. It was an epic day to say the least! 

This tour was our big splurge in El Calafate. We booked through MarPatag after visiting a few different travel agencies in town. It's always cheaper to book in town, but this one also books up fast, so don't leave it until the very last minute if you're there during the high season.

You can read all about our experience on the Gourmet Glaciers tour here, but suffice it to say, we loved it!

This full-day boat tour to the glaciers runs around 10-12 hours. It includes lunch, visits all the different glaciers, and there's a guided walk halfway through the tour. 

Option 2: Glacier Ice Trekking Tour

If you're looking for something a bit more adventurous, another way to experience Los Glaciares National Park is by joining an ice trekking excursion, where you'll be walking on top of the Perito Moreno Glacier!

To do this ice trek, you first need to reach the glacier and that involves taking a small boat to Bajo de las Sombras and crossing over the Rico Arm. Once you reach the glacier, you get all geared up with crampons and ice axes, plus you'll get a lesson on ice trekking from your trusty guide. 

This trek is done in a single file following your guide in front. There is absolutely no deviating or venturing off on your own because there are crevasses and seracs.

Doing a glacier trek on your trip to El Calafate is a splurge. These tours typically cost quite a bit considering the logistics involved, expert guides, required equipment, and the limited number of participants, plus there's only one glacier trekking operator and that's Hielo y Aventura.

You can typically get these Perito Moreno glacier tours cheaper once you arrive in El Calafate if you're willing to do the legwork, but you'll want to book your spot a few days in advance since this tour completely sells out. 

This Perito Moreno Glacier trek includes transportation to and from the park, a professional guide, and required ice trekking equipment. It has a maximum of 10 participants per guide.

Option 3: Walk the Boardwalks

If you want to explore Los Glaciares National Park at your own leisure, then walking the boardwalks and stopping at the balconies is the way to do it. This is also the most budget-friendly option of seeing the Perito Moreno Glacier. 

You can easily reach the national park by bus. For example, Caltur offers daily bus departures from the El Calafate Bus Terminal to Los Glaciares National Park with a morning departure and an afternoon departure. It's a 1.5-hour journey there and they give you about 6 hours in the national park. If you prefer a guided tour, they have another option that includes hotel pick-up and drop-off. 

Even though we did the glaciers boat cruise, we enjoyed the landscapes of Los Glaciares National Park so much, that we took the bus to the park and spent the day marvelling at the Perito Moreno Glacier...again!

The boardwalks are known as pasarelas and you have 5 different routes to choose from ranging from 30-minute to 1.5-hour loops. You also have balconies or balcones along the way with benches where you can stop and enjoy the views. One of the loops is even wheelchair accessible. 

Central Circuit - 600 metres - 1:00 hs - Easy

Lower Circuit - 1100 metres - 1:15 hs - Challenging

Forest Trail - 570 metres - 0:45 hs - Moderate

Shoreline Trail - 1117 metres - 1:30 hs - Moderate

Accessible Circuit - 565 metres - 0.30 hs - Very easy

Aside from walking these loops, you can also visit Laguna de los Témpanos or the Iceberg Lagoon. The chunks of ice that break off the Perito Moreno Glacier end up in this channel and it's a cool spot to check out. 

There's also a restaurant inside Los Glaciares National Park called Restó del Glaciar Perito Moreno. We grabbed some sandwiches, drinks and brownies here. It was a good spot to warm up, plus we couldn't believe that we had glacier views from the restaurant. 

If you're looking for a relaxed way of exploring the park and seeing the Perito Moreno Glacier at your own pace, this is the way to do it. 

Evening

Dinner at Restaurante Morrison

Whichever option you choose for exploring Los Glaciares National Park and the Perito Moreno Glacier, it'll be a full day activity and you'll be arriving back in El Calafate in the late afternoon or evening. This brings us to dinner!

One place we enjoyed was Restaurante Morrison. Everything on their menu sounded delicious: Patagonian lamb roulade with rustic potatoes, rib eye with vegetable terrine, lemon pork with sweet potatoes. Plus, they had pastas, stews and risottos. 

Don't even get me started on desserts! The pears in red wine with calafate berries were simply divine. 

Day 2 in El Calafate

Morning

Breakfast in town

Start the morning off with breakfast at Olivia Coffee Shop. If you're craving something beyond the classic café con leche y medialunas (coffee with milk and croissants), you'll enjoy the variety at this cafe. 

You can get waffles with caramelized apples and cinnamon, smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, avocado on toast with a poached egg, and so much more. 

Their coffees are really good and their pastries are simply tempting. 

Flamingoes in Laguna Nimez

Laguna Nimez Reserve is situated on the shores of Lago Argentino, within walking distance from the center of El Calafate and it's a really nice place for a morning stroll. 

The reserve encompasses a range of habitats, such as wetlands, lagoons, and Patagonian steppe, making it a unique ecological area. 

It is home to various bird species, including flamingoes, black-necked swans, and many types of ducks and geese. The best times for bird-watching are early morning or late afternoon when the birds are most active. There are even bird-watching huts along the way, so you can observe the birds without disturbing them. 

There are well-marked trails that wind through the reserve, allowing visitors to explore the area. These trails are relatively easy and suitable for all ages and fitness levels. 

You can explore on your own (that's what we did!) but there's also an option to join a guided tour if you'd prefer a more in-depth look at the local ecosystem.

The reserve can be visited year-round, but the best time is during the spring and summer months when the majority of birds are nesting and the weather is more pleasant.

The entire walk through Laguna Nimez Reserve is 3 kilometres long and takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete.

Lunch

Have lunch at Isabel Cocina al Disco

One restaurant we enjoyed and visited time and again is Isabel Cocina al Disco. They have locations across Patagonia and we ate at the ones in El Calafate and Ushuaia multiple times! 

This restaurant specializes in comida al disco, meaning food cooked on a plow disk. Yes, I'm talking about the plow disk from farming equipment! This is an old style of cooking that was widely used in the countryside and especially in Patagonia.

You can get all sorts of things cooked al disco: lamb, pork, trout, chicken and beef. Plus you can choose between different types of sauces for your base. 

It's a really fun experience and the dishes are very filling. If you're looking to sample some traditional Argentine cuisine, this is a must-try dish.

Afternoon

I'm going to present you with two different options for your second afternoon in El Calafate: one for nature lovers and one for museum lovers. 

These two options also work well depending on whether you have a sunny day or one of those infamous Patagonian weather days where being outdoors is not an option!

Option 1: Ranch life at Estancia Nibepo Aike

There are so many fun day tours from El Calafate and one that we particularly enjoyed was a ranch day at Estancia Nibepo Aike.

This is one of the more famous estancias in El Calafate and it is located within the boundaries of Los Glaciares National Park as the estancia predates the formation of the park!

This tour is a fun way to get a look at a working ranch, enjoy the beauty of the national park, and have a traditional Patagonian BBQ or asado. 

We did the half-day tour to Estancia Nibepo Aike and we watched the gauchos herd sheep, attended a sheep shearing demonstration, hiked around the property to the shores of Lago Argentino, and enjoyed a feast of a meal! If you opt for the full-day option, you can tack on a 3-hour horse trek. 

It's a 1.5-hour journey from El Calafate to the estancia down dirt roads, so you'll get to enjoy the scenery. We got lucky and even spotted some guanacos along the way!

This day trip to Estancia Nibepo Aike can be booked as a half-day or full-day excursion. The full-day option includes horseback riding in Los Glaciares National Park with a guide.

Option 2: Glaciarium and Ice Bar

The Glaciarium Patagonian Ice Museum is a modern and informative museum dedicated to the glaciers, particularly focusing on the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. It's a really cool building that is designed to look like a glacier from the exterior. 

Glaciarium features extensive information about the formation of glaciers, their impact on the global ecosystem, and the unique features of the Patagonian glaciers. It's designed to educate visitors about the importance of these natural wonders, with a significant emphasis on the effects of climate change. 

Perhaps one of the main draws to the Glaciarium is GlacioBar, an ice bar where everything, including the glasses, is made of ice! 

It's a fun experience where you can enjoy a drink in a sub-zero environment. They have ice sculptures, including an igloo, and colourful lights, so it makes for some fun photo ops.

You are given a poncho with a hoodie to stay warm. We were only there for 15-20 minutes, but we enjoyed the novelty of it. It's probably more fun if you visit with a group of friends, though we befriended a solo traveller and took turns snapping fun photos. 

The museum is located about 6 kilometres from the center of El Calafate. However, there's a free shuttle bus service that runs between the town and the museum, making it easily accessible for tourists.

Glaciarium is open daily from 12:00 to 8:00 pm, but as always, check the website for the most up-to-date schedule as these things can change. 

Evening

Dinner at Mi Rancho Restaurant Patagónico

You won't be hungry for dinner if you go with the estancia visit since that includes an afternoon welcome snack and a massive BBQ, however, if you opt for the museum visit to Glaciarium, then you'll definitely want some food afterwards. 

Mi Rancho is a great restaurant that serves lots of different Patagonian dishes. You can order barbecued lamb with oven-roasted potatoes, guanaco stew in tomato sauce, and braised ossobuco with risotto. 

For dessert, you can choose between creme brulee with rosehip, flan with dulce the leche, and a calafate berry parfait. As you can see, lots of local ingredients on the menu!

Stroll along Avenida del Libertador

Last but not least, use your last evening in El Calafate to stroll the main street, Avenida de Libertador. You'll find lots of souvenir shops here, especially around Aldea de los Gnomos, where you can pick up some Argentine souvenirs to take back home.

If you're in the mood for a nightcap, you'll find plenty of bars and breweries with outdoor terraces, where you can cheer the end of a fantastic trip to Patagonia. 

That's it for our action-packed 2 day El Calafate travel itinerary. If you have a bit more time, you can check out our list of things to do in El Calafate for even more ideas.

Travel Tips for 2 Days in El Calafate

Weather: When you travel in Patagonia, you need to be prepared for the ever-changing weather conditions. Bring warm and waterproof clothing and dress in layers. Remember it's cooler in Los Glaciares National Park when you're standing in front of a glacier than it is in the town of El Calafate. 

Transportation: I would recommend booking private transfers or joining guided tours. The travel time to the national park is 1.5 hours each way. I don't think it's worth renting a car if you only have 2 days in El Calafate. 

Tours: If you're visiting El Calafate during high season, you'll want to make sure you book your tours in advance. The most popular experiences (like ice trekking and glacier boat tours) can fill up days ahead. 

Accommodations: The same thing goes for booking your hotel in El Calafate. If you want to stay at a particular place, book well in advance. This is one of the more popular destinations in Patagonia and most hotels and glamping domes will be operating at full capacity during the summer months.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,baa4b7a7cf2f5b8a2ac941011ad829930965b730

So you've come to the end of your trip to Argentina, you've only got a couple of days in Buenos Aires before you catch your flight back home, and you need to pick up a gazillion souvenirs for your friends, family, neighbour, pet, boss, and hey, maybe even something for yourself!

What should you even buy?

Well, lucky for you, in this gift guide, I'm highlighting some traditional Argentine souvenirs that are easy to find, representative of the country, and will pleasantly surprise your recipients back home.

These Argentina souvenirs are going to include a mix of sweets and desserts that are easy to transport, clothing items that are typically worn by gauchos, an array of leather goods, practical items you can use in the home, and some unique handicrafts. In short, there's bound to be something for whoever you want to buy a gift for.

Here is my list of 25 souvenirs to buy in Argentina during your trip!

Mate and bombilla

One of the first things you'll likely notice when you land in Argentina is the locals walking around with a mate and a thermos in their hands.

Yerba mate is a traditional South American beverage that is popular in Argentina and some of its neighbouring countries. It is made from the dried leaves and twigs of the yerba mate plant, which are steeped in hot water to create an infusion.

The mate is a classic Argentine souvenir and you typically buy it as a set: you have the mate which acts as the cup and holds the yerba mate (it is typically made from a gourd or carved wood), and then you have the bombilla which is a metal straw with a filter at the end that allows you to sip the hot mate tea without ingesting the loose leaves.

You can complete the gift by buying a bag of yerba mate in the supermarket. There is usually an entire aisle dedicated to different varieties of yerba mate! Throw it in your checked luggage and be prepared to answer questions about this strange green herb; it's perfectly legal, but not everybody knows what it is!

Dulce de leche

Dulce de leche is a staple in Argentine cuisine, and you'll likely be eating it by the spoonful before the end of your visit to Argentina!

So what is dulce de leche? This sweet caramel-like spread is made by slowly simmering sweetened condensed milk until it thickens. Its rich and velvety texture makes it the perfect accompaniment to pastries, toast, cake, pancakes, or ice cream.

If you scan the dessert menu at any Argentine restaurant, you'll find at least one dessert item featuring dulce de leche, and if not, you can always order it on the side. 

You can find dulce de leche in any grocery store, and let's not forget about all the dulce de leche specialty items - cookies, chocolates, liqueurs and more.

If you're a true dulce de leche aficionado, I would recommend checking out Dulce de Leche & Co. This is a chain specializing in all sorts of dulce de leche products like alfajores, chocolates, liquors and more.

They have locations across the city in neighbourhoods like Palermo, San Telmo, Recoleta, just to name a few. Plus, they also have locations in other Argentine cities.

This is one of the best Argentina souvenirs for that special someone with a sweet tooth!

Alfajores

Since we're talking about sweets, another option for an easy Argentine souvenir to take home is a box of alfajores!

An alfajor consists of two soft, crumbly biscuits joined together by a layer of dulce de leche, creating a heavenly combination of flavours and textures.

It can then be dipped in dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, merengue, a sugar glaze - you name it!

The style of alfajor can greatly vary from one province to the next and sometimes from one city to the next. 

Havanna, which originated in Mar del Plata, is one of the best-known commercial alfajor brands in Argentina. They have stores all over the country; some of these stores double as cafes, where you can enjoy a coffee and some of their other sweet treats.

If I'm buying alfajores at my local supermarket, Terrabusi Glaseado (coated in merengue) is my go-to. However, if you can, it's always best to get your alfajores from an artisanal shop.

There are also alfajores that are filled with jams - quince, raspberry, fig, peach, blackberries and other options galore. The jam-filled and glaze-coated variety is especially popular where we live in the Province of Córdoba. These make great gifts from Argentina and are a hit whenever we bring them to family and friends.

Artisanal Chocolates

Chocolates are another great gift idea to take back home for friends and family, and

Artesanal chocolates are especially popular if you're travelling in Northern Patagonia. In places like Bariloche, Villa La Angostura, San Martin de Los Andes, and El Bolson, you can walk down the main street and hit multiple artisanal chocolate shops!

Chocolates here are sold by weight, so you can select the size of your chocolate box (250 grams, 500 grams, or 1 Kilo!) and then pick and choose the chocolate bars or bonbons you want.

There are countless varieties featuring milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate with almonds, peanuts, walnuts, caramel, nougat, brittle, and let's not forget the cream fillings featuring mint, raspberry, strawberry, lemon, banana, passionfruit and more!

If you can dream it, they've made it into chocolate.

Artisanal jams

Artesanal jams, jellies and marmalades are another easy souvenir to buy in Argentina.

In fact, you'll probably get to try some new and unusual flavours as you travel the length of the country! There are all sorts of fruits and berries that are specific to certain regions.

Some unique jam flavours to try include:

Zarzamora, a type of wild blackberry that is both sweet and tart

Rosa mosqueta, a prickly sweetbriar rose found in Patagonia that is floral and tangy

Membrillo, quince which is very sweet with a hint of sour

Cayote, a type of squash that results in a sweet and fibrous jelly

Frutos del bosque, local forest berries that are full of antioxidants

So, perhaps along with a jar of dulce de leche, you can also buy a few jars of your favourite jam. This is one of my go-to Argentine souvenirs that my family loves.

Asado tools

As you'll discover during your travels in Argentina, asado or barbecue is a very big deal! And if you want to take your BBQs back at home to the next level, then why not stock up on the right tools?

This can include a BBQ grill set featuring a shovel, poker, carbon tongs, a grill fork, or a grill cleaning brush. So many tools that you've maybe never encountered before. 

And then, you have the actual iron grill for barbecuing meat, the disco de arado for hearty dishes, and the a provolone melting pan because gooey cheese is a dish in and of itself around these parts!

Long story short, if you see a store selling asado tools, go in and peruse, because you'll discover a whole new world of cooking utensils. 

Knives

One of the best souvenirs from Argentina that we have bought time and time again is knives. But I'm not talking about just any type of knife, I'm talking about gaucho knives!

Whether you want it for practical use or display is up to you. There are countless types of knives to choose from when shopping for gaucho knives. In the past, some were used for fighting, some for butchering, and some were multipurpose, everyday country knives.

If you go into a shop that specializes in traditional Argentine souvenirs, you'll find a section featuring knives you can use for asado or barbecue back home, as well as ornate knives that come with sheaths.

The most famous gaucho knife is the facón - if you travel rural Argentina, you'll still see the gauchos wearing it tucked into a sash on their backside. And yes, back in the day, this one in particular was used to resolve arguments!

But hey, it's a one-of-a-kind Argentine souvenir and it can come in handy in the kitchen.

Wooden boards and wooden plates

If you're looking for useful souvenirs of Argentina that you can use in your kitchen, then consider a tabla de madera or wooden board.

The tabla is typically used to serve picada, an assortment of snacks including deli meats, cheeses, olives, bread, peanuts and anything you can snack on before the big barbecue is ready. It's like Argentina's version of a charcuterie board.

The tabla is also used to serve the meat once it comes off the grill. You can cut it right on the tabla and then place it in the middle of the table for people to serve themselves, or you can walk around the table with the tabla in your hand, allowing people to select their cuts.

Along the same vein, you can also buy wooden plates to eat the asado. Everyone gets their own individual wooden plate, and you can get them customized with a burned design.

Boina

The boina has a long history in Argentina, closely intertwined with the country's cultural heritage. The origins of the boina can be traced back to the Basque region, spanning across northern Spain and southwestern France.

Basque immigrants brought the boina to Argentina during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it gained popularity, especially among the gauchos who found it practical for their way of life as the boina provided protection from the elements, including the scorching sun and chilly winds.

Today, you can buy a boina as a souvenir. You have the cotton boinas for the summer months, which are lighter and breathable, and you also have the wool boinas for the winter months. 

For something a bit more elegant, you can also find embroidered boinas featuring floral motifs. One of my favourite Patagonia souvenirs that I got for myself is a green boina embroidered with flowers.

If you're looking for a traditional Argentine souvenir, this is a nice addition.

Alpargatas

Another idea for souvenirs to buy in Argentina is alpargatas.

The alpargata is a traditional Argentine footwear that has a long history in the country. Its origins can be traced back to the rural communities of Argentina, particularly the gauchos, who were skilled horsemen and agricultural workers. 

The alpargata was originally crafted as a practical and durable shoe suitable for their lifestyle. The shoe consists of a canvas or cotton and a sole made of jute rope or rubber. 

Over time, the alpargata transitioned from being solely functional footwear to a symbol of Argentine culture. They are also really comfortable, so they've gained popularity and can be work by anyone, especially during the warmer months.

I think alpargatas are a nice souvenir from Argentina because it's a fun way to integrate Argentine style into your wardrobe back home!

My favourite pair of alpargatas I own is from 1813 (they take orders via Instagram). They are handcrafted, made to size, and I love that they have the Argentine coat of arms. When I wear them, I feel like I carry a little piece of Argentina, even when I'm not there.

Poncho and ruana

The poncho and ruana have a long and storied history in Argentina, deeply rooted in the country's cultural heritage and indigenous traditions. These garments date back to pre-Columbian times when indigenous communities across South America used them for protection from the elements.

The poncho, a rectangular or square-shaped outer garment with a hole for the head, was crafted using various materials such as wool, alpaca, or llama fibres. It provides warmth and insulation against the cold, making it ideal for the diverse climates found throughout Argentina.

The ruana is similar to a poncho, but with an open front, and it originated from the Andean region and was adopted by indigenous communities across Argentina. It was typically woven using alpaca or sheep wool and often adorned with intricate designs and vibrant colours.

Over time, the poncho and ruana evolved to reflect the cultural fusion of indigenous, Spanish, and gaucho influences in Argentina. These garments became iconic symbols of Argentine identity, associated with the rural lifestyle, traditional celebrations, and folkloric dances.

Most shops selling traditional Argentine souvenirs carry both ponchos and ruanas.

Leather goods

Another great Argentine souvenir idea is leather goods! The country is renowned for its quality leather and craftsmanship, so if you're looking for a souvenir that exudes style and sophistication, and that you can incorporate into your wardrobe and daily life, then Argentine leather goods are a great option.

You can buy Argentine leather in specialty leather shops, leather outlets, and even in the ferias (outdoor markets typically held on weekends). Here you'll find leather jackets, handbags, belts, wallets, gloves, boots and all sorts of accessories.

I'm a fan of Nimes in Buenos Aires. They have natural and vegetable-tanned leather, and their handbags are divine! I own their Chañar handbag, and I'm always eyeing their latest creations. They are located in the Palermo neighbourhood, just a couple of blocks from Plaza Serrano, so if you're going to be in the area, it's a place to check out.

When it comes to buying leather jackets, I think Calle Florida is your best bet. This is a pedestrian street in Buenos Aires that is lined with stores, including numerous leather shops! You'll especially find a high concentration of leather stores along the 4 northern blocks of Calle Florida once you get north of Tucumán.

I would suggest browsing or window shopping before you commit because there are so many stores and they are all filled with beautiful leather creations in an assortment of colours and styles. It's good to know your options! I bought a brown leather bomber jacket along Calle Florida that I absolutely love, and it's still going strong over a decade later!

As a shopping tip, leather should feel soft and smooth, as opposed to rough or stiff to the touch. Also, when in doubt, smell the leather! It should have an earthy, woodsy smell as opposed to smelling like chemicals.

Tango music or vinyl records

Tango is everywhere! During your visit to Buenos Aires, you'll either go to a tango show or, at the very least, see a couple dancing tango on the street. 

Tango music and dance originated in the late 19th century in the working-class neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires, and its roots can be traced back to a melting pot of cultures, including European immigrants, African rhythms, and indigenous influences.

The music is passionate, soulful, and haunting and typically features an orchestra of bandoneons (sometimes confused for accordions), violins, piano, double bass, guitar and drums, in addition to a singer.

If you enjoy tango music, you can take a little piece of Buenos Aires with you by buying some tango music or vinyl records as a souvenir.

Argentine wine

Next, let's talk about wine, because who doesn't like getting a bottle as a souvenir?

Argentina is famous for its wine production, offering an excellent variety of wines that have gained international recognition. The country's diverse geography, including high-altitude vineyards along the Andes Mountains in Mendoza and in Cafayate in the north, provides ideal conditions for grape cultivation and wine production.

Malbec, a red wine varietal, is considered Argentina's flagship grape. It thrives in the high-altitude vineyards of Mendoza and produces bold, full-bodied wines with rich flavours of dark fruits, spices, and velvety tannins. We love the wines by El Enemigo; they are a splurge but well worth it.

Apart from Malbec, Argentina also produces exceptional wines from other grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Bonarda, and Tempranillo are notable red wine options. For white wines, Torrontés, a floral and aromatic grape variety, stands out as Argentina's signature white wine.

These are nice souvenirs to buy in Argentina for friends and family back home. Just watch those weight restrictions and check how many bottles you can bring back into your home country!

Leather BKF chair

Really, a leather chair as a souvenir to bring back all the way from Argentina? Isn't that a bit excessive and...bulky?

Hear me out!

The BKF chair, also known as the Butterfly chair, is an iconic piece of furniture that originated in Argentina. It was designed in 1938 by three young architects: Bonet, Kurchan, and Hardoy. The name ""BKF"" derived from their initials.

The BKF chair is characterized by a folding frame and a sling seat made of leather or fabric. The chair's distinctive shape resembles that of a butterfly, with its gently curving lines and wing-like seat. It provides a comfortable and ergonomic seating experience while maintaining a stylish and modern aesthetic.

And guess what, you can visit the BIG BKF showroom and buy one in person, or have it shipped to you anywhere in the world!

Yes, this souvenir is a bit of a big ticket item, but if you love modern design it can make a great addition in your home.

Argentina football jersey

Argentina is a three-time World Cup champion with a passionate following around the globe. If you count yourself in that group, why not buy an Argentina football jersey?

The jersey features blue and white stripes and three golden stars representing the three World Cup wins: 1986 with a 3-2 win against West Germany, 1978 with a 3-1 victory against the Netherlands, and 2022 with a nerve-wracking triumph against France with 4-2 in penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. We were sweating during that last game!

This is a classic Argentine souvenir to buy, especially if you're a football fan. Plus, you can wear it for every World Cup and cheer on Argentina's national team from wherever you are in the globe.

You can also find all sorts of other Argentina World Cup souvenirs in the form of t-shirts, magnets, stickers, scarves, caps - you name it!

Bombacha gaucha

If you're looking for practical souvenirs from Argentina that you'll actually wear, might I suggest a bombacha gaucha?

Also known as a bombacha de campo, this is a style of pants that's typically worn by gauchos. It is typically pleated around the waist, then it becomes kind of loose and puffed as it goes down the legs, and it tightens at the ankles.

Now, oddly enough, these pants are originally from Turkey! The story goes that at the end of the Crimean War in 1856, a Frenchman offered Argentina a stock of 100,000 pairs of loose pants that had initially been ordered by the Turkish army.

These pants were soon distributed across Argentina, where the gauchos noted they were super comfortable for horseback riding and doing work in the countryside. It wasn't long before the bombachas were adopted as part of the gaucho uniform.

My husband loves these pants and wears them regularly, whether we're in Argentina or back in Canada. I can understand why; you can bend, stretch, or squat in these bombachas without having your movements restricted.

For everyday work pants, Pampero, Ombu and Gaucho are some of the more popular brands. 

However, if you're looking for a special pair of bombachas, go to Aux Charpentiers in Buenos Aires. This store was founded back in 1888, and it has been supplying traditional Argentine riding and work clothes ever since.

Wool and alpaca sweaters

Wool and alpaca sweaters are great souvenirs to buy in Argentina seeing as the country has a long-standing tradition of wool production. The country's rugged landscapes, provide ideal conditions for raising sheep and alpacas, yielding fine fibres needed for these soft and warm sweaters.

Whether you're travelling in Northern Argentina or down in Patagonia, you can find wool and alpaca sweaters in local shops and markets and they're something you can start wearing right away.

Polo-related items

Polo has a long and respected history in Argentina, with the country being recognized as one of the world's premier destinations for the sport.

Polo was introduced to Argentina by British immigrants in the late 19th century, who brought their passion for the game to the fertile plains of the Pampas. The vast grasslands of the Pampas provided ample space for polo fields to be established, and the sport quickly gained popularity among the local Argentine population.

The combination of skilled horsemanship, the abundance of quality horses, and a favourable climate for year-round play contributed to the rapid growth of polo in Argentina.

The Argentine polo scene began to flourish in the early 20th century, with the formation of polo clubs, the organization of tournaments, and the emergence of talented Argentine players.

If you're in Buenos Aires, you'll be able to pick up a few polo-themed souvenirs like polo shirts, boots, mallets and more at Arandú Talabartería. They focus on artisanal products that represent Argentina's countryside and its lifestyle and they have a big polo section.

Handcrafted jewelry

Argentine silver jewelry often showcases a blend of traditional and contemporary styles. From intricate filigree work to bold and modern designs, there is a wide range of options to suit different tastes.

You can find 'Silver 925', which is a precious metal that consists of 92.5% pure silver, or you can also find 'Alpaca Silver', which is an alloy that does not contain any actual silver. Alpaca silver is primarily composed of copper, nickel, and zinc, making it an affordable alternative with a silver-like appearance.

Also, keep an eye out for Rosa del Inca, meaning 'Incan Rose'. This is the national stone of Argentina and it has a beautiful pink colour.

You can shop for jewelry at the outdoor ferias.

Fileteado porteño signs

Next on our list of unique souvenirs to buy in Argentina is fileteado porteño. This is a distinctive and ornate style of art that originated in Buenos Aires during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It emerged as a decorative form predominantly on the city's transportation, such as horse-drawn carriages and later on buses, trucks, and taxis.

The term fileteado is derived from the Spanish word filete, which refers to the fine lines and ornamental filigree patterns characteristic of this style. Fileteado porteño is a fusion of various artistic influences, including European art nouveau, Italian Renaissance motifs, and the bold lettering of the Art Deco period.

The origins of fileteado porteño can be traced to the work of immigrants, particularly Italian and Spanish artists, who brought their artistic skills and cultural aesthetics to Buenos Aires.

There are still fileteado artists keeping this tradition alive and even teaching workshops, and you can also find their works for sale in the outdoor fairs - the San Telmo Market is an especially popular place for this!

Pottery

Another idea for souvenirs to buy in Argentina is pottery. This is something you'll come across a lot if you're travelling in Northern Argentina.

Skilled artisans create pottery using techniques passed down through generations, and the clay used for these pottery pieces is typically sourced from local riverbanks, known for its high quality and workability. 

One distinctive characteristic of pottery in Northern Argentina is the vibrant and intricate hand-painted designs that adorn the surfaces of the pieces. The designs often incorporate geometric patterns, stylized animals, or representations of the local vegetation.

You can find decorative pottery, but it's also possible to find everyday items you can use in your home, like clay plates, clay serving dishes, and even clay cooking pots.

Just make sure you pack this carefully (lots of padding!) so it doesn't break in transport. We bought a huge clay pot to bring back to Canada, which we wanted to use to make locro, and sadly, it arrived broken in two pieces.

Textiles and tapestries

Whenever I visit Northern Argentina, I like to browse the local markets for traditional souvenirs - namely, textiles and tapestries.

The northern part of the country has its own distinct style with bold, warm colours and geometric patterns. You can find tablecloths, placemats, serviettes, wall hangings, bed covers, rugs and more. 

If you have a thing for interior design and you want to bring a touch of Argentine style into your home, there are many ways to do so with some unique hand-picked pieces. 

Books by Argentine authors

Buenos Aires is a city of bibliophiles. In fact, the city has more bookstores per person than any other city in the world! This makes it a great place to buy some souvenirs of Argentina for the book lover in your life.

If you only have time to visit one book shop in Buenos Aires, I would choose El Ateneo Grand Splendid. This is a former theatre turned movie theatre turned bookstore.

For a gift that captures Argentina’s soul beyond the tangible, consider picking up a book by one of the country’s celebrated authors. Jorge Luis Borges is perhaps the most iconic, known worldwide for his mind-bending short stories like those in Ficciones.

This list of the greatest Argentine books of all time is a good one to peruse for inspiration.

Leather-bound journals

I know I keep talking about leather, but there really is so much leather in Argentina that you can get a whole range of leather products.

So, another Argentine souvenir to consider is a leather-bound journal or notebook.

This is something that you could pick up at the start of your trip if you want to document your travels across Argentina by sketching or writing journal entries.

Alternatively, it also makes for a nice gift to take back home, especially if you have someone who enjoys writing in your life.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,6e840d1c5c163a5b5d1ae35ca2ce7d8b9ec13062

San Carlos de Bariloche, more commonly known as Bariloche, is situated in the Province of Río Negro in Northern Patagonia.

The city sits on the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake, boasts an epic backdrop featuring the Andes Mountains, and has a distinct Swiss-alpine architectural style.

In many ways, Bariloche is the perfect introduction to northern Argentine Patagonia. It's a short flight from Buenos Aires, it offers plenty of outdoor adventures, plus it has a great food and beer scene with restaurants, breweries, and chocolate shops galore!

The nice thing about travelling to Bariloche is that it's a versatile destination that can suit your exact travel style. You can have a relaxing holiday at a lakeside cabin, or tackle a multi-day trek sleeping in mountain refugios. You can enjoy the city's shopping and restaurant scene, or fill your days with outdoor activities like kayaking and horseback riding.

Bariloche is whatever you want it to be. So with that in mind, we're going to share some of the best things to do in Bariloche, fun tours and easy day trips you can go on, foods to try, where to stay and so much more.

The following is the ultimate Bariloche travel guide!

Getting to Bariloche

Air

There are multiple flights per day connecting Bariloche with Buenos Aires and other major cities across Argentina.

If you're flying in from Buenos Aires, you have two airport choices: Aeroparque (AEP) which is in the city, or Ezeiza (EZE) which is in the outskirts. The flight time is around 2 hours and 15 minutes.

Alternatively, you can also get flights from Cordoba, Mendoza and El Calafate, though some destinations don't offer these flights daily.

Aerolineas Argentinas is the national airline, plus you also have low-cost carriers like FlyBondi and jetSMART.

Bus

Numerous bus routes connect Bariloche with the rest of the country. Two of the most popular companies are Via Bariloche and Via TAC. You can browse their routes and rates on BusBud.

Train

You can also reach Bariloche by train aboard the Trén Patagónico which crosses Patagonia widthwise from Viedma to Bariloche.

There's only one departure per week, so if you really want to take the train, you'll have to plan accordingly.

Keep in mind that there is no direct train from Buenos Aires to Bariloche, so you'll first have to catch a connecting train from Buenos Aires to Viedma in order to travel aboard the Trén Patagónico.

Here's our guide detailing how to get to Bariloche.

Things to do in Bariloche 

1. Take a Bariloche Walking Tour

A great way to learn about Bariloche's history and get a good lay of the land is by joining a guided walking tour of the city center.

There are numerous Bariloche walking tours to choose from each with a different focus. You have tours that focus on German immigration, Indigenous Peoples, secrets of Bariloche and so much more!

I would recommend doing this early on in your visit so you can retrace your steps to any places that catch your interest.

The most popular walking tour in Bariloche is this 1.5-hour German Footprint walking tour that looks at the different waves of German immigration that took place before and after World War II and how these shaped Bariloche.

2. Drive the Circuito Chico

One must-do activity in Bariloche is to drive the Circuito Chico, which literally means ‘short circuit’.

This scenic drive follows the shores of Lago Nahuel Huapi as you leave Bariloche heading northwest, and it loops around various lakes before circling back towards Bariloche.

Along the way, there are scenic lookout points, breweries, restaurants, hiking trails, kayak rentals, and everything you could possibly want for a beautiful day out in nature.

This drive is typically done in half a day, including stops for food and photos; however, you could easily turn it into a full-day activity by hiking Cerro Llao Llao or kayaking Lago Moreno (you can rent kayaks at Playa Sin Viento).

If you don't want to rent a car, you can join a guided tour of Bariloche's Circuito Chico. This half-day tour includes a stop at Cerro Campanario (it's worth paying to ride the chairlift to the top), and you visit a few different landmarks and lookout points along the way. 

3. See Isla Victoria & Arrayanes Forest by Boat

The most popular boat excursion in Bariloche is the trip to Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest.

This excursion departs from Puerto Pañuelo and the catamaran cruises the waters of Nahuel Huapi towards the Quetrihué Peninsula where you visit the famous Arrayanes Forest. This is a protected forest with cinnamon-coloured trees that are said to have inspired Disney's Bambi.

After visiting the forest, you journey on towards Isla Victoria where you disembark and go on a guided hike of the island.

Alternatively, you can use this time to explore the island at your leisure. There’s a nice beach called Playa del Toro and though the waters are chilly year-round, that doesn’t stop people from enjoying a summer dip!

It is possible to spend the night on the island at Isla Victoria Lodge, but you'll need to book ahead of time.

This boat tour visits Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest. It runs 6-7 hours in length and it's a day filled with epic mountain and lake views, as well as plenty of time to explore the island on foot.

Tip: You can also visit the Arrayanes Forest from the town of Villa La Angostura if that works better for your itinerary.

4. Visit Puerto Blest & Los Cantaros Waterfall

Puerto Blest is located on the western end of Lake Nahuel Huapi close to the border with Chile. It's one of the most secluded and pristine arms of the lake surrounded by dense Valdivian rainforest.

The journey begins in Puerto Pañuelo and after an hour of sailing, you'll see Centinela Island, where the remains of Perito Moreno lie - he was the father of Argentine national parks.

From there, the trip continues to Puerto Cántaros, where you disembark to visit Cascada de los Cántaros, Lago Cántaro and a 1500-year-old Alerce tree.

This is raw nature at its finest and if you want to stay overnight, you can do so at Hotel Puerto Blest, though you'll need to book in advance and also keep in mind that this hotel is only open seasonally.

Guests staying overnight can hike to Lago Frías whose milky green waters flow down from the glacier on Cerro Tronador.

You can book your day trip to Puerto Blest and Los Cantaros Waterfall here. This is a 9-hour excursion and you will spend time outdoors hiking, so dress accordinly, especially if you're visiting outside the summer season.

5. Admire the views from Cerro Campanario

Cerro Campanario is a must-visit spot for its beautiful panoramic views of the region. 

You can reach the mountaintop by either hiking or taking the chairlift. I'd recommend the chairlift since there are much prettier hikes in Bariloche!

Once you reach the top, you'll have 360-degree views of Nahuel Huapi Lake, Moreno Lake, El Trébol Lagoon, San Pedro Peninsula, Isla Victoria, Cerro Otto, Cerro López, Cerro Goye, Cerro Bellavista, Cerro Catedral and the Llao Llao Hotel.

Cerro Campanario was voted one of the best panoramic views in the world by National Geographic, so you know it's good!

6. Enjoy year-round fun at Cerro Catedral

Cerro Catedral or Cathedral Mountain is named after its cathedral-like peaks and spires which resemble the steeples of a Gothic church. This mountain is primarily known for its ski resort. 

Catedral Alta Patagonia is the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere, offering over 120 kilometres worth of ski runs. The resort caters to all skill levels, from beginners to expert skiers and snowboarders.

The mountain also offers opportunities for snowshoeing and snowmobile tours during the winter season.

When the snow melts, Cerro Catedral transforms into a hub for summer activities. Hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and paragliding are all popular activities.

Numerous trails crisscross the mountain, offering varying levels of difficulty and providing panoramic views of the Nahuel Huapi Lake and the surrounding Andes.

A system of lifts, including gondolas and chairlifts, operates year-round, providing breathtaking aerial views of the region.

7. Hike Cerro Tronador

Cerro Tronador translates to Thundering Mountain and it gets its name due to the deafening sound that occurs when massive chunks of ice break off the glaciers and crash down.

The peak of Cerro Tronador stands 3,491 meters above sea level making it the highest mountain in the Argentine Lake District.

This extinct stratovolcano sits on the border between Argentina and Chile, and it draws avid mountaineers.

It is possible to visit the base of Cerro Tronador on a day trip from Bariloche, where get views of the Ventisquero Negro Glacier.

You can book your full-day excursion to Cerro Tronador to see the hanging glacier. This is a 9-hour tour where you'll get to see some hard to reach corners of Nahuel Huapi National Park.  

8. Try Patagonian Craft Beers

Bariloche is synonymous with craft beer and you could easily visit a different brewery each day of the week and not run out of places.

Some of our personal favourites include:

Cervecería Patagonia – this place has epic views! Sip on your beer and admire the views of lakes and snow-capped mountains.

Cervecería Gilbert – this is a cozy and rustic brewery that serves up Patagonian dishes like deer stew, wild boar and trout.

Cervecería Manush – this brewpub does a nice beer flight which pairs well with their gourmet burgers.

9. Kayak Bariloche's Lakes and Rivers

With Bariloche's endless crystalline lakes and rivers, there are plenty of kayaking opportunities available. 

Lago Moreno and Lago Nahuel Huapi are two popular destinations for kayaking excursions.

Don't worry if you're not a super experienced kayaker, the guides will choose a kayaking route suited to your level of experience and also weather conditions seeing as some lakes are windier than others.

If you're up for an adventure, opt for a full-day kayaking tour that includes a picnic-style lunch and the opportunity to enjoy a swim.

This Bariloche kayaking tour is tailored to your skill level and it's a great way to enjoy a day out in Argentina’s Lake District. Snacks, beverages, and a picnic are provided.

10. Join a Horseback Riding Tour

If you're looking for some active things to do in Bariloche, consider going on a horseback riding tour. It's such a fun way to enjoy the Patagonian landscapes. 

We did a guided horse trek around Lago Gutierrez where we got to ride through forests, past mountains, and along the lakeshore before returning to camp for a traditional Argentine barbecue. 

This horseback riding tour takes you on a 2-hour trail ride along the foothills of the Andes Mountains. Back at the ranch, you get to enjoy a traditional Argentine BBQ lunch. 

11. Tackle the numerous Hiking Trails

One of the best things to do in Bariloche is to go hiking. You are in a city surrounded by mountains, after all!

There are hundreds of trails to choose from, which can make it a little tricky to decide exactly where to go. All Trails has a list of 200+ hiking trails in and around Bariloche to give you an idea.

Refugio Frey is without a doubt the most iconic hike. It departs from the base of Cerro Catedral in Villa Cerro Catedral about a 30-minute drive from downtown Bariloche. This trail is 9.5km one way, and while you can go up and down in one day, many choose to stay overnight in the alpine refugio which is part of the charm.

If you're not an experienced hiker and you find the prospect of venturing off on a solo hike a bit daunting, you can book a hiking tour. The local guides will tailor the experience based on your fitness and experience level and choose a trail accordingly.

This private hiking tour runs 6-8 hours and can be tailored to your interests and fitness level. It includes snacks, lunch and all necessary hiking equipment.

12. Go up Cerro Otto for more views

More views? Yes, more views! When you're visiting a mountain city, there are views to be had at every turn. 

Cerro Otto is a mountain located in Nahuel Huapi National Park and it stands 1405 meters tall. 

This mountain is a year-round destination. During the winter months, you can go skiing, snowboarding and sledding. Meanwhile, during the warmer months, you can enjoy the hiking trails as well as the zipline and aerial adventures. 

You can take a chairlift to the top of Cerro Otto. It's a 12-minute journey and you get to enjoy panoramic views along the way. 

If you get hungry at the top, there's a rotating restaurant called Confitería Giratoria Cerro Otto.

13. Tour the interior of Bariloche Cathedral

Bariloche Cathedral is also known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Nahuel Huapi. 

The cathedral was built between 1942 and 1944 in a French Neo-Gothic style featuring stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings. 

It was the work of Alejandro Bustillo, an architect known for many iconic structures across Patagonia including the Llao Llao Hotel.

The location couldn't get any better. The cathedral overlooks Nahual Huapi Lake and it's encircled by a plaza with beautiful gardens. 

14. Pose by the Bariloche city sign

Argentina loves its city signs and they're always a good opportunity to snap some photos and capture memories.

The Bariloche city sign sits on the shores of Nahual Huapi Lake, so the views are pretty phenomenal. 

There's usually a line of people waiting to snap their pictures, so the person behind will take a picture for the person in front and the favour is returned down the line.

15. Try your Hand at Fly Fishing

While most avid fishermen would likely book themselves into a fishing lodge for a week, it is possible to book fly fishing day tours from Bariloche.

These trips are a great way to experience the Patagonia wilderness while accompanied by an expert fishing guide who knows where to catch the best trout - rainbows, browns and brookies!

Some of the fly fishing spots of choice include the Limay River, Manso River, and Pichi Leufu River in the heart of Nahuel Huapi National Park.

These tours are high ticket items, but they include private transportation from your hotel to the fishing sites, boats when required, one bilingual guide per 2 anglers, and a full lunch with unlimited wine and beer, plus all necessary fishing gear.

Gratuities and the fishing license from the national park are extra.

This Bariloche fly fishing tour is rated a solid 5 stars and it has 275+ rave reviews. The private tour is open to seasoned fisherman as well as first-timers who want to reel in a big catch.

16. Sample Artisanal Patagonian Chocolate

One of the best things to do in Bariloche if you have a sweet tooth is to go chocolate shop hopping. There are even more chocolate shops than there are breweries, so you really have no excuses. A few chocolate shops to visit include:

Mamuschka - enjoy breakfast or afternoon tea with delicious cakes and pastries, and then stock up on chocolates to take back home.

Rapa Nui - features a cafe, an ice cream parlour and a skating rink all under the same roof. Their chocolate-covered raspberries are super famous and worth trying.

Benroth - third-generation chocolatiers working their magic. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate - they do it all, and they do it well!

17. Visit the Havanna Chocolate Museum

Havanna is one of Argentina's most iconic brands and it is best known for its alfajores, a traditional Argentine treat consisting of two crumbly cookies filled with a creamy caramel-like spread called dulce de leche.

The Museo del Chocolate Havanna in Bariloche offers visitors a unique opportunity to delve deep into the world of chocolate, exploring the production process and history from its ancient Mesoamerican roots to its arrival in Europe and subsequent global spread.

The museum has some impressive sculptures made entirely out of chocolate depicting some of the local wildlife including foxes, penguins, pumas and condors!

After visiting the museum, you exit through the Havanna cafe where you can purchase some Argentine souvenirs or have a coffee and an alfajor.

Best time to visit Bariloche

Bariloche is a versatile destination with something to offer year-round. However, the best time to visit largely depends on the type of activities you're interested in. Here's a breakdown of Bariloche's seasons to help you decide:

Summer (December to February)

Summer in Bariloche is warm with averages of 18°C to 25°C (64°F to 77°F). It's an ideal time for outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, mountain biking, and fishing. 

The days are long, providing ample time for exploration. This is also peak tourist season, especially in January, so expect larger crowds and higher prices.

Fall (March to May)

Fall in Bariloche is cooler with averages dropping gradually from 18°C to 10°C (64°F to 50°F). 

This is one of the best times for photography, as the forests turn shades of red, orange, and gold. It's also great for hiking and enjoying the landscapes. 

There are fewer tourists than in summer but it's still a relatively popular time to visit, especially for those seeking the fall foliage.

Winter (June to August)

Winter in Bariloche is cold with averages ranging from -2°C to 7°C (28°F to 45°F). Snowfall is common, especially in the higher areas. 

This is when Bariloche turns into a winter sports hub. The slopes of Cerro Catedral are busy with skiers and snowboarders. Plus, you can enjoy other winter activities, like snowshoeing, are also popular. 

July is the peak winter month, primarily due to the winter school holidays in Argentina, so expect many national tourists.

Spring (September to November)

Spring in Bariloche sees averages from 6°C to 17°C (43°F to 63°F). As the snow melts, hiking trails become accessible again, and the region starts to bloom, providing a fresh and vibrant landscape for various outdoor activities. 

While the early part of spring can be quiet, by November, as temperatures rise, tourists begin to return.

The best time to visit Bariloche really depends on your preferences. If you love winter sports, visit between June and August. If hiking, warm weather, and water activities are your preference, December to February is ideal, but prepare for more crowds. For a quieter, scenic experience with fall colours, consider March to May. For a balance of good weather and fewer tourists, late spring (October and November) might be the best choice.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,efa070486561e149b4fef1bf183569fee846c070

El Chalten is the Trekking Capital of Argentina, some would even say the Trekking Capital of South America! This mountain town is located in the northern part of Los Glaciares National Park and it is home to some of the most beautiful hiking trails in the world.

For starters, the views in El Chalten are just magical. You can see the granite peaks of Mount Fitz Roy from the centre of town, you have the turquoise waters of the Las Vueltas River to the east, and a slew of trailheads that beckon you in different directions.

Most visitors to El Chalten choose to spend about 3 days here, which is enough time to tackle the main hikes and get a taste of what this remote corner of Patagonia is all about.

I'll admit I spent a bit more time in El Chalten, so I've handpicked what I think are some of the unmissable experiences in town. 

Here's how to spend 3 days in El Chalten, Argentina during your visit!

3 Days in El Chaltén Itinerary

Day 1 in El Chaltén

Getting to El Chaltén

First things first, you're going to need to make your way to El Chaltén. 

Since there is no airport in this small town, you'll be flying into El Calafate (there are multiple daily flights from Buenos Aires) and making your way from there. 

When it comes to reaching El Chaltén, you have 3 options: you can pick up a rental car from the airport, you can book a private transfer or you can take the bus. 

You can read our complete guide on how to get to El Chaltén from El Calafate here. 

The bus terminal in El Chaltén is basically non-existent, so the bus will first stop at the Visitor Centre where you'll get a quick introduction and some warnings about hiking in Los Glaciares National Park (you don't mess with the weather around these parts!) and you'll then be dropped off at the entrance of town.

From this point, you can hail one of the remis or taxis waiting around, or you can roll your luggage to your hotel like we did. 

Check-in at your hotel

We stayed at Hostería Vertical Lodge and we had a great experience, so that's our first-hand recommendation. 

The rooms were very spacious - great for sprawling out all your trekking gear! Breakfast was abundant with plenty of sweet and savoury options. And they also offered a packed lunch service, which we made use of for our two big hiking days.

This hotel is located right at the entrance to town, so we only had to roll our suitcases two blocks from where the bus dropped us off. 

The property overlooks the Las Vueltas River and the Paredón which is the rock climbing wall, plus we were right next to the trailhead to Mirador de los Cóndores and Mirador de las Águilas (two hikes we'll talk about shortly). 

If you're looking for something more luxurious and unusual, you may want to consider one of the glamping spots (like Chalten Camp!) on the outskirts of town.

Grab lunch in town

For your first day in El Chalten, I would recommend grabbing lunch at Patagonicus. Today we're keeping all the activities clustered around the south part of town, including meals!

The menu is simple - pizzas, soups and salads. But you also don't want to eat a super heavy meal before tackling your first hike!

Hike to Mirador de los Cóndores for Sunset

I'm going to include a hike for your first day in El Chaltén because this is Argentina's trekking capital and this will be a good warm-up for what's to come the next day. Don't worry, this is a short hike - a little steep, but with big rewards.

Mirador de los Cóndores translates to Vultures Lookout and it's named so because the trail leads you up to a cliff where you can often see condors circling overhead. 

This is a 2.6-km out-and-back trail with a 130-metre elevation gain. It's a fairly short trail but it's a little steep, so take it easy and use your trekking poles if you brought some. 

I've seen families hike this trail with young children, so it's certainly doable. As I said, this will serve as a warm-up for the bigger trails to come over the next two days. You want to pace yourself during your 3 days in El Chalten. 

Once you reach the top of the lookout, you'll be rewarded with views of the town of El Chaltén below, Mount Fitz Roy on the horizon and Río de las Vueltas encircling the town. This is where you get those postcard shots of El Chaltén, so bring your camera. It's a nice spot for sunset since you're facing west.

If this trail sounds a little too easy and you want more of a challenge, you can add Mirador de Las Águilas, which breaks off from the same trail and offers views of Lago Viedma. 

However, I'd maybe save this for your last morning in town, right before you leave. This lookout faces east so it's the best spot to catch sunrise in El Chaltén.

Day 2 in El Chaltén

Hike to Laguna de los Tres

This is going to be the most physically demanding day of trekking in El Chaltén, but I can guarantee you'll bear witness to some of the most unbelievable landscapes in all of Patagonia! I am not exaggerating.

So, the plan is to aim for a day hike to Laguna de los Tres. This is the most iconic trek in El Chaltén, it offers impeccable views of Mount Fitz Roy, and it leads you up to a glacial lagoon that is hidden from sight until you complete the most grueling ascent up a rocky slope. 

Laguna de los Tres is 12 kilometres one-way, making it 24 kilometres round trip. Technically, it's listed as a 22-kilometre trail round trip, but it's longer if you're staying near the entrance of town and you have to cross all of El Chaltén to reach the trailhead - that was our predicament! - so prepare for a long day of trekking.

I'm not going to lie, this trek is hard! I mean, the first 9 kilometres are easy if you're used to walking long distances, but the final kilometres is a steep scramble that'll make you feel like you're on a stair climber and it'll make you question some of your choices. 

The good thing is that once you reach Laguna de los Tres, you can rest while enjoying the most epic views of the whole trip.

The descent is rough, though not as bad as the climb, and the hike back feels long. The last 2 kilometres back are the worst simply because of the distance you've walked in one day. You probably won't want to move the next day - I certainly didn't! - but I still think it's worth it. 

If the above description of Laguna de los Tres sounds horrible and you're ready to throw in the towel before you've even arrived in El Chaltén, fret not. Laguna Capri is here to save the day!

Hike to Laguna Capri

Laguna Capri is located 4 kilometres into the hike to Laguna de los Tres, so 8 kilometres round trip, making it a much more manageable distance.

Also, Laguna Capri is a slice of paradise. The lagoon is a vibrant blue and it offers views of Mount Fitz Roy in the background. 

To be honest, our initial hiking goal was to reach Laguna Capri and then head back to town, but it was still so early in the morning when we reached the lagoon and we weren't tired. We figured we were almost halfway to Laguna de los Tres, so we spontaneously decided to keep hiking. 

You can do the same. Aim for Laguna Capri and see how you feel when you get there. If your legs have had enough, you can head back to El Chaltén and enjoy a chill afternoon in town. Maybe visit one of the breweries or do some souvenir shopping.

However, if you feel like challenging yourself and you want to see what lies further ahead, then continue on to Laguna de los Tres. The choice is yours. 

Dinner in El Chaltén

We decided to treat ourselves to a celebratory dinner after hiking Laguna de Los Tres. We didn't even bother going back to the hotel for a shower and a change of clothes - we knew we wouldn't be able to get out of bed if we gave ourselves a moment of rest after walking 24 kilometres!

We chose Hosteria Senderos, a boutique guesthouse with its own in-house restaurant. We arrived looking sweaty and dishevelled, but they didn't bat an eyelash. One of the perks of a mountain town!

For dinner, we ordered a blue cheese risotto with walnuts and sundried tomatoes, as well as a lentil stew. We paired that meal with a bottle of Shiraz, and you bet we ordered dessert! We had a chocolate mousse and an apple pancake with calafate berries ice cream.

We were so hungry after completing that trek and this meal was a well-deserved reward. 

Day 3 in El Chaltén

Hike to Laguna Torre to see Cerro Torre

Another day, another trek! For your last day in El Chaltén, I would suggest hiking to Cerro Torre. 

Cerro Torre stands 3,128 metres tall and its vertical granite face is a prestigious target for mountaineers from around the world. However, for those interested in hiking rather than technical climbing (I think that's most of us!), there are trails that offer breathtaking views of Cerro Torre without the need to scale its walls.

The most common approach for hikers is the trail to Laguna Torre, a glacial lake that offers spectacular views of Cerro Torre, Torre Egger, Cerro Standhardt and other nearby peaks. 

The hike to Laguna Torre is considered moderate and can be completed as a day hike. The trail leads hikers through diverse landscapes including forests, rivers, and moraines, culminating in the stunning vistas of the mountain peaks.

The trek to Laguna Torre is approximately 17.5 kilometres round trip with an elevation gain of around 500 meters. It usually takes between 3 to 4 hours one way to reach the lake, depending on your pace and how often you stop to enjoy the views and snap photos.

We could see the Cerro Torre in the distance for most of our hike, but by the time we arrived at the shores of Laguna Torre, the mountain peak was covered in passing clouds. That's just how it goes with Patagonian weather! The prize at the end of this hike is the view of the granite spires behind the lagoon if the weather cooperates. 

Laguna Torre is a glacial-fed lagoon and often has small icebergs floating around. The lagoon's water is a bit brown in colour, so that's a little warning for you if you're coming with high expectations after visiting Laguna de los Tres. I know I was!

We found this to be a very easy hike and because it was relatively flat, we were able to keep a steady pace. 

Dinner at a brewpub

One spot we really enjoyed in El Chalten was La Zorra Taproom. 

They specialize in burgers, pizzas, loaded fries and salads. Basically, good ol' hearty pub grub, which is precisely what you're craving after a long day of hiking. 

Because this is a brewpub, they have their own beers on tap and they have lots of fun ones to try like Scotch Ale, Passion Summer and Choco Milk. 

We ate here a couple of times - burgers and loaded fries both times! - and I'll also mention that they have a location in El Calafate if you're heading that way. 

Is 3 days in El Chalten enough?

I get it, there is a lot to see and do in Patagonia and it can be difficult to carve out enough time in your travel itinerary to fit it all in. 

I would say 3 days in El Chalten is enough time to tackle some of the most iconic hikes, marvel at the lagoons and rocky granite spires, and explore the small town. 

Of course, you could always tack on a few extra days to do more - hike additional trails, go kayaking, try rock climbing! - however, if other destinations are calling your name, you can certainly move on after 3 days in El Chalten, knowing you've hit the highlights.

Make time for El Calafate so you can visit the Perito Moreno Glacier and spend the day at an estancia, and if time allows for it, maybe even add on a few days in Ushuaia so you can experience the city at the end of the world.

How long should you stay in Ushuaia? That is a great question!

Personally, I think 3 days in Ushuaia is the minimum amount of time you need to get acquainted with the southernmost city in the world.

This is also a good amount of time to play it safe for travellers embarking even further south on an Antarctica cruise. 

As you might expect, the weather at the end of the world can be unpredictable and storms can delay flights, so it's always best to arrive in Ushuaia a few days early to ensure you don't miss your once-in-a-lifetime cruise!

Could you stay longer in Ushuaia? For sure! 

On our very first Ushuaia trip, we spent a total of 2 weeks, however, I'll be the first to admit that my husband and I favour slow travel and that may not be everyone's style.

All this to say that there is plenty to see and do in Ushuaia, especially if want to tackle a few hikes and make time for a few day trips. 

In this blog post, I'm going to provide a detailed breakdown of how I would spend 3 days in Ushuaia as a first-time visitor looking to get the most out of a short trip!

3 Days in Ushuaia Itinerary

Day 1 in Ushuaia

Ideally, you'll have arrived in Ushuaia and checked into your hotel the night before.

If you're looking for a luxurious stay at the end of the world, you can't go wrong with Arakur Ushuaia Resort and Spa, but if you want a few more options have a look at our Ushuaia hotel guide.

Start off your first morning in Ushuaia with breakfast at your hotel and fuel up for an action-packed day!

Day 1 of your 3 days in Ushuaia is going to feature some iconic landmarks and activities that you simply cannot miss during your visit. 

Cruise the Beagle Channel

If there's one activity that can't be missing on your Ushuaia itinerary, it's a Beagle Channel cruise!

The Beagle Channel is the body of water that separates the main island of Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands. It's also one of three passages that connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean; the other two being the Strait of Magellan and the Drake Passage. 

We had beautiful weather on the day of our cruise and we got to see sea lions sunbathing on a rocky outcrop, thousands of cormorants swirling over an island, penguins waddling on Martillo Island, and we had epic views of the mountains and Ushuaia Harbour.

We also sailed past the red-and-white-striped Les Éclaireurs Lighthouse, which is often mistaken for the Lighthouse at the End of the World.

There are lots of different Beagle Channel tours to choose from, however, it's important to note that not all tours are created equal! All this to say, figuring out the best Beagle Channel tour for you does take a bit of research.

When it comes to vessels, you can choose between catamarans, sailboats and fishing boats - keep in mind that the smaller the vessel, the more you'll feel the movement if the seas are rough. 

Most importantly, while most tours approach the shores of Martillo Island to see the penguins, only one operator is licensed to disembark for a guided walk among the penguins. This is something that's often not mentioned when you're booking your tour.

The penguins tour is a small group tour with limited numbers to protect the penguins and their habitat. It's a 1-hour walk with a guide where you get to Magellanic penguins and sometimes even Gentoo penguins. As you can imagine, it does come with a higher price tag.

This Beagle Channel boat tour focused on nature and wildlife is a 5-star best-seller. You get to sail past Isla Alicia, Isla de los Pajaros, Isla de Lobos, Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse, and you disembark at Bridges Islands for a mini trek. (No penguins on this tour!)Alternatively, this Beagle Channel cruise to Martillo Island includes the walk with penguins, plus you also get to visit Estancia Haberton. This tour involves a minivan ride to the estancia and then a boat ride aboard a Zodiak to reach Martillo Island. (No lighthouse on this tour!)

Tip: The End of the World sign is located just east of the port where the Beagle Channel tours depart from. Take a moment to snap your photo next to the sign either before boarding your cruise or upon your return. It's a right of passage!

Lunch at Isabel

One restaurant we really enjoyed during our travels across Patagonia is Isabel Cocina al Disco. This is a restaurant that specializes in dishes cooked on a plow disk, a very traditional way of cooking with its roots in the working estancias. 

Well, this restaurant has locations across several Patagonian cities, so we ended up visiting a few of them! 

Their menu in Ushuaia features one of the local specialties which is centolla or king crab. They also have other seafood options like trout and hake. Plus, you can choose if you want your dish with potatoes, rice or noodles. 

We tried the king crab plough which was super succulent. We were impressed by the rather generous pieces of crab meat! 

Be warned, these dishes are for sharing! They say a plough can feed 2 people, but I think you can even feed 3. We found it to be a lot of food, especially considering they bring you a freshly baked loaf of bread to the table!

Old Ushuaia Prison

Another attraction not to be missed on a trip to Ushuaia is the Old Ushuaia Prison, better known as the Prison at the End of the World. 

Ushuaia was founded as a penal colony for repeat offenders and hardened criminals, and the first prisoners began to arrive in 1884.

Why build a prison at the very bottom of Argentina? Well, this was done by the Argentine government as a way to ensure control over Tierra del Fuego and to increase the Argentine population in such a remote part of the country. 

The prisoners helped build their own prison. They had to transport rock and timber from the nearby forests, first using wagons pulled by oxen and later travelling aboard the narrow gauge railway, today known as the Train at the End of the World, but more on that later.

Today, the Ushuaia Prison is a major tourist attraction that houses several museums. Each of these five museums has its own wing and these converge in a central hall.

During your visit, you can wander through the Prison Museum, the Maritime Museum, the Antarctic Museum, the Art Museum and the Art Gallery.

You should allot at least a couple of hours to explore Ushuaia Prison in depth.

Take the Double Decker Bus Tour

If you only have a few days in town, the Ushuaia double-decker city bus tour is a good way to see the city beyond the downtown core. 

This tour runs 1 hour and 10 minutes in length, but to be clear, this is not a hop-on-hop-off tour. 

This is a sightseeing tour where you drive past some landmarks and you only disembark at two points: first at the Devil's Lagoon, which is a green space in the city outskirts, and then at the Ushuaia Aeroclub where you get nice panoramic views of the city. 

A narrated audio guide plays for the duration of the tour where you get to listen to commentary about Ushuaia’s history and the landmarks along the way.

Some of the attractions you'll get to see include the Malvinas Monument, the first graveyard, the first school, and the harbour. However, you'll also get to see quotidian places like the hospital, the university and residential neighbourhoods. 

If you want to see Ushuaia's less touristy side, this is a nice, short tour that ticks the box. 

You can prebook the Ushuaia double-decker bus tour here, or buy tickets in person at the bus. If you opt for the latter, make sure you arrive early, especially if you're visiting during high season as the bus can fill up. 

Dinner at Taberna Del Viejo Lobo

For dinner, check out Taberna del Viejo Lobo, the southernmost tavern in the world. This is a quirky tavern with an attached thematic gallery featuring dioramas.

We went for a picada which is Argentina's version of a snacking board featuring lots of little bites. This one had crab cakes, mussels, breaded shrimp, chicken sticks, deli meats, cheeses, roasted peppers and more. Even though this is considered a snack, it was a meal in and of itself!

We also got dessert and let me tell you, their vanilla cake with dulce de leche, whipped cream, peaches and merengue was simply divine!

Day 2 in Ushuaia

Day 2 of your 3 days in Ushuaia is all about exploring Tierra del Fuego National Park and enjoying some of the activities inside the park including hikes and a rather famous train ride!

Ride the End of the World Train

The Train at the End of the World is also known as the Train of Prisoners and the Southern Fuegian Railway.

This steam train is the southernmost functioning railway in the world, so if you're a train aficionado, you'll want to make time to travel aboard!

Personally, I love travelling aboard trains - especially heritage trains that have so much history behind them. Having already tackled two famous train rides in Patagonia - the Old Patagonian Express and the Tren Patagónico - I knew I wanted to experience this one as well. 

The End of the World train is a 50-minute journey that travels the final 7 kilometres of the original prisoner’s train route. This is the same journey the prisoners would have completed on a daily basis to log the forest in order to build their prison and also provide firewood.

The ride begins at the End of the World train station, which is located 8 kilometres west of the city of Ushuaia. 

Along the way, you get to see landmarks like the Burnt Bridge, the Bull's Canyon and La Macarena Waterfall where you have the opportunity to disembark for a few minutes. 

The train then continues towards the national park boundary where you enter Tierra del Fuego National Park. Here you get to see the tree graveyard left behind by the logging work of the prisoners.

Finally, you reach the National Park Station, where you disembark once more so the train can turn around. 

At this point, you can either get back on the train and return to the starting point, or explore the national park. I would recommend the latter! 

Send mail from the Southernmost Post Office

From the Tierra del Fuego National Park Train Station, you can walk down to Bahia Ensenada Zaratiegui. This is where you'll find the most famous post office in Ushuaia: the End of the World Post Office!

Set on the shores of the Beagle Channel, this tiny post office sits on a pier and is made of corrugated metal and wood. Inside, a wood-burning stove burns even during the summer months and the walls are covered in postcards for you to choose from. 

As a heads up, it normally takes around 3 weeks for snail mail to reach your intended recipient, so be patient!

Aside from sending mail, you can also get your passport stamped here. I've heard people say you shouldn't get these novelty stamps, but I've been doing it for years in places like Machu Picchu, Checkpoint Charlie, and Easter Island and it's never been an issue at border control. Do so at your discretion!

Hike in Tierra del Fuego National Park

Next up, let's talk about hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park, which you can do independently or as part of a guided tour. 

We spent two days hiking independently in different sections of the park, so I'll give you a few options. 

Option 1: Senda Costera

My favourite hike in Tierra del Fuego National Park is Senda Costera or the Coastal Path. This hike begins next to the End of the World Post Office on Bahia Ensenada Zaratiegui and ends at the Alakush Visitor's Centre.

This is a beautiful 3 to 4-hour hike that's considered medium-level difficulty. Along the way, there are lots of little beaches and coves where you can stop for a picnic or to have a rest. 

The Coastal Path is also a great opportunity for bird-watching. 

There are a few sections where the trail weaves through the forest, but for the most part, you are following the shores of the Beagle Channel. 

While this isn't a challenging hike, there are some uphill stretches and it can also get a bit muddy, so you'll want to wear hiking boots. You can read more about this trail here.

Option 2: Lapataia Bay

Lapataia Bay marks the end of the road on the American continent. Here you’ll find a sign that marks the end of National Route 3, which is also the final stretch of the Panamericana. You can drive all the way to Alaska from this point! But let's focus on the hiking.

The Lapataia Bay sector of the park is home to 6 short hiking trails. You'll probably end up visiting some combination of these trails if you sign up for a guided tour of Tierra del Fuego National Park.

The hiking trails in this sector include:

Paseo de la Isla - good for viewing aquatic birds

Laguna Negra - black lagoon in the process of becoming a peat bog

Mirador Lapataia - short but steep climb to the Lapataia Bay lookout

Del Turbal - home to bogland and abandoned beaver lodges

Castorera - where you can see beavers hard at work

Senda de la Baliza - boardwalk that turns into a trail

Pack a picnic or have a snack at Alakush

We packed a picnic for our full day of hiking at Tierra del Fuego National Park, however, we also visited the cafeteria because we were hungry after tackling some of the different hikes.

Inside the park, you'll find the Centro de Visitantes Alakush or Alakush Visitor's Centre. This is a great place to get some info, have a rest, use the washrooms and visit the small displays that delve into the history of this park.

There's also a cafeteria-style eatery inside the visitor's centre where you can have lunch. The meals here are simple - think empanadas, tortillas, cake and hot and cold beverages. Not amazing by any means, but it'll get you out of a pinch if you're hungry.

Dinner at Kuar 1900

Kuar 1900 is another restaurant we thoroughly enjoyed in Ushuaia. We even went back a second time to sample more of their seafood pasta menu!

We really enjoyed the king crab risotto, which was rich and creamy and featured giant chunks of crab meat. That may be the best dish on their menu!

We also tried the black squid ink ravioli stuffed with salmon paired with a four-cheese sauce. A wonderful combination!

If you have room left for dessert, I would highly recommend their saffron pears with mascarpone and wild berries. It was simply divine. 

Day 3 in Ushuaia

Having covered the main Ushuaia attractions on the first two days of this itinerary, I would recommend using the last of your 3 days in Ushuaia to book one of the many Ushuaia tours and day trips available, and there are lots to choose from!

Book an excursion from Ushuaia

Option 1: Hike to Laguna Esmeralda

This first option is for all the hikers out there. 

There are so many hiking options in and around Ushuaia that it can be hard to narrow it down! Mountain passes, lagoons and glaciers - which should you choose?

Laguna Esmeralda is located some 20 kilometres northeast of Ushuaia, so it's fairly accessible. Plus it's a hike that you can do independently or as part of a guided tour.

The hike gets its name from the Emerald Lagoon, which is the reward at the end of a trek that spans 9 kilometres there and back. 

This trek can take 3 to 4 hours round trip depending on your hiking pace and the number of breaks along the way. 

Like with many trails in Ushuaia, this one can get quite muddy at times. You'll want proper hiking boots and hiking poles! Also, dress in layers as the weather is ever-changing.

This small group hiking tour to the Emerald Lagoon includes transportation to and from Ushuaia. It's limited to 10 participants and you get a packed lunchbox to enjoy during the hike. 

Option 2: Paso Garibaldi by 4x4

This next option is for those travellers looking for a bit of adventure! How about crossing Paso Garibaldi in a 4x4?

The Garibaldi Pass is a mountain pass and the only paved route across the Fuegian Andes. It's also the highest point of Argentina’s Ruta Nacional 3.

If you're arriving or leaving Ushuaia by bus, you'll drive across this mountain pass. 

However, for a truly epic experience, you can join a 4x4 tour that takes a detour and goes off-road following the shores of Lago Escondido before linking up to Lago Fagnano.

Lago Fagnano is a lake of glacial origin that stretches 98 kilometres across Argentina and Chile (it's known as Lago Cami across the border). 

This tour is also a bit of a cultural experience because you get to enjoy an Argentine asado or BBQ with a bottle of Malbec - the perfect pairing!

This 4x4 off-road tour of Escondido Lake and Fagnano Lake explores glacial lakes and features epic mountain vistas. It also includes a BBQ lunch on the shores of the lake. 

Dinner at Bodegón Fuegino

You'll find bodegones all over Argentina; these are traditional restaurants that focus on classic home-cooked dishes and generally serve big portions.

We got the cod in a roquefort cream sauce with pumpkin puree, and also the pan-fried chicken breast in a mushroom cream sauce. The meal was hearty and filling, which was exactly what we needed after a busy day of exploring Ushuaia. 

For dessert, we got the calafate ice cream which is made with a berry only found in Patagonia. Legend has it that if you eat calafate berries you will surely return to Patagonia!

So is 3 days in Ushuaia enough?

Hopefully, this 3 days in Ushuaia travel itinerary has given you a good idea of what you can see, do and eat in the city at the bottom of the world!

As I mentioned earlier, I think 3 days is the minimum amount of time you should give yourself to explore Ushuaia, visit the main sites and enjoy a day trip. 

Any less and you'll feel rushed or miss out on attractions, which would be a shame having travelled all this way. Who knows when you'll be back again?

Of course, you can certainly choose to stay longer! You could allot 5-7 days in Ushuaia and still not run out of things to do because there are so many great hikes and day trips to go on. 

If you're thinking of staying a bit longer, check out our complete Ushuaia travel guide for more ideas of things to do in and around the city. 

For those who want to explore beyond Ushuaia, the lakeside town of Tolhuin is a super relaxing destination and a great way to unwind for a few days after a busy travel schedule. 

Now you know how to spend your 3 days in Ushuaia, here are a few more travel tips to help you start planning your trip to the southernmost city. Wishing you a wonderful trip!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,2dba5210d2dd7311c70092ed2189a0178a89ac38

Best Bariloche Walking Tours

1. German Footprint and Nazi Presence

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 1.5 hours | ✅ Book it!

The German Footprint and Nazi Presence tour is one of the most popular walking tours in Bariloche. 

This historical tour uncovers the real stories and myths surrounding the waves of German immigration starting with the early settlers who started arriving in Bariloche in the early 1900s up until after World War 2. 

The tour begins with the chronicle of Carlos Wiederhold, a Chilean-German immigrant who founded Bariloche, and who is remembered in the town's full name, which is San Carlos de Bariloche.

You also learn about Otto Meiling, an avid German mountaineer who travelled to Argentina in his early twenties. He was responsible for many first ascents in Nahuel Huapi National Park and was also the founder of Club Andino de Bariloche, a mountaineering club that is still active today!

The walking tour then moves on to the Nazi presence and the role the Argentine government played in allowing former Nazi spies and officers into the country, and how many of them started new lives...and how some were found. 

If you enjoy history, this Bariloche tour offers a fascinating look at Patagonia's German influence, which is something that is still seen today.

Over the course of this tour, you'll learn about the indigenous people's history while exploring Bariloche's downtown on foot. 

You'll visit Bariloche Cathedral and hear about the relationship between the indigenous people and the Catholic Church.

4. President Perón in Bariloche Historic Tour

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 hours | ✅ Book it!

If you're looking for a historical tour of Bariloche through the lens of President Perón and his impact on the city, you'll want to check out this tour. 

For starters, this tour runs 3 hours in length, making it twice as long as the tours we've looked at so far. It also takes you beyond downtown Bariloche and you'll be exploring some of the city outskirts by using public transportation. 

Juan Domingo Perón is a very divisive figure in Argentina. He was a military man, the creator of Peronism, and three times President - he served two terms, was overthrown, and managed to return again.

During this tour, you'll visit Bariloche's Military Mountain School and Museum. Plus, you'll also walk by the National Commission of Atomic Energy and stand in front of the island where a secret atomic project was planned.

Perón sought to extract scientific talent from Nazi Germany and believed that any project spearheaded by a German scientist was bound to be successful.

In 1949, he hired Ronald Richter, a German Austrian-born scientist who convinced him that he could produce controlled nuclear fusion in a process that would supply enormous quantities of cheap energy. That became known as the Huemul Project. 

Perón gave Richter carte blanche, but the project turned out to be a fraud! You can learn all about it on this tour.

""Fascinating deep dive into Juan Peron's life, military and political career. The original populist! We also visited a very interesting museum. Diego's story telling and knowledge on the topic was enthralling. Highly recommended!"" -A Tripadvisor Reviewer

5. German Trekking to Berghof and Mountain Stories

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

Lastly, we are looking at this Bariloche walking tour that starts in the city centre and ends on a mountaintop!

This tour starts off in Bariloche's German Neighbourhood or Barrio Alemán, which is today known as Barrio Belgrano. This is where some of the first German immigrants settled and it's an area with alpine-style homes. 

After walking through the neighbourhood, you'll join the trailhead that leads to the top of Cerro Otto, though that's not your end destination. Instead, you'll hike up to Refugio Berghof!

Berghof was the home of Otto Meiling, the Andean pioneer we mentioned earlier. During the 1930s he built several buildings here. His private home was originally called Bergfreude (literally Mountain Joy in German) and it later became known as Berghof (literally Mountain Farm in German).

He also built two bungalows as well as a workshop for manufacturing skis, thus giving Bariloche its start as a ski destination!

The hike to Refugio Berghoff takes about 2 hours and you'll be rewarded with mountain and lake views. At the top, you'll visit a small museum while your guide contextualizes Argentine-German politics from the 1930s and 1940s.

At the end of the tour, you can choose to make your way back to Bariloche one of three ways: hike back into town, pay for your own taxi, or buy a ticket to ride the Cerro Otto gondola down.

If you decide to take this tour, make sure you wear hiking boots and appropriate outdoor clothing. Also, bring water and maybe even a snack for the way. 

This tour does require a bit of effort. In order to take part in this experience, you should be able to walk 5 kilometres with a 400-meter gain.

""Very nice walk through historic Bariloche, the German neighborhood, the forest and the mountains with incredible views of the Andes and the Nahuel Huapi lake. Our guide Diego was an accomplished trail runner but he was patient with us and very affable. Otto Meilings house/museum was very intriguing. Fresh beer at the Berghof shelter was the perfect touch after the uphill part of the walk."" -A Tripadvisor Reviewer

FAQs About Walking in Bariloche

Is Bariloche a walkable city? Bariloche's city centre is quite compact, so it's a walkable city. There are steep hills as you move away from the lakeshore, but most tourists stick to Calle Mitre (the main pedestrian thoroughfare). Are there any free walking tours in Bariloche? Walking tours are never free. Even the ones that advertise themselves as free expect you to tip the guide for their time. Grupo Vision Turismo runs a free walking tour in Spanish Monday-Saturday at 9:45 am. The meeting point is San Martin 398. How long do I need in Bariloche? Bariloche is the gateway to northern Patagonia and you need at least 2-3 days to see the city and explore Nahuel Huapi National Park. 

Choosing your Bariloche Walking Tour

So which of these Bariloche walking tours should you choose?

If you don't have any particular preference, I would go for the German Footprint tour since it'll help contextualize the city's history and how it was shaped by immigration. This tour runs 90 minutes in length and it's a classic tour for first-time visitors to Bariloche. 

Alternatively, if you're looking for something similar in length, you can choose between the tour focused on Patagonia's indigenous peoples or the tour that reveals myths and secrets about Bariloche with a stop at a chocolate shop. 

The tour about Perón in Bariloche is for those who want a longer history tour, and the Berghof tour is for those who want some history paired with a hike and beautiful mountain views. 

These are the top-rated walking tours in Bariloche, so whichever you choose, you're bound to have a wonderful time. The choice is yours!

After all that walking, be sure to check out some of Bariloche's breweries and cool down with a pint.

These historic ranches are a gateway to the region’s rural heritage - a place where you can go horseback riding, enjoy home-cooked meals paired with wine, and learn about gaucho traditions against the backdrop of the Andes Mountains.

While staying at a wine hotel in Mendoza is a great way to get acquainted with the Winelands, spending a few nights at an estancia is an opportunity to delve a little deeper and experience a different side of Mendoza.

That's why we're highlighting 5 estancias in Mendoza where you can experience Argentine hospitality while adventuring into the rugged mountains.

1. Rancho e Cuero

Rancho e Cuero is a massive estancia that encompasses 3,000 hectares of land in the Andes Mountains. The landscapes are ever impressive boasting vast tracts of land with rivers, valleys, and rugged cliffs.

This ranch has been in the hands of the Palma family for over 250 years, and it now welcomes guests for a one-of-a-kind experience in rural Mendoza.

The estancia features six suites that are rustic yet quaint. This is not a 5-star hotel nor does it pretend to be, but rather the magic is in the remote, wild landscapes and the sense of adventure that the place offers.

When you stay as an overnight guest at Rancho e Cuero, all of your meals are included. Because the estancia is quite remote and requires a fair bit of effort to reach, once you arrive, you won't be leaving to explore the city of Mendoza or go on any wine excursions - the estancia is the destination! 

Here, guests can enjoy unlimited horseback riding, trekking and fishing. 

This is one of a handful of estancias in Mendoza that offers a 'country day' where you can come and visit for the whole day.

2. Los Chulengos

Estancia Los Chulengos is situated in Valle de Uco along the foothills of the Andes Mountains.

The estancia's origins are humble; it began as a precarious shelter built along a river bank where a gaucho looked after the cows, sheep, goats and horses. With the passing of time, this crude refuge turned into a summer getaway for the Palma family.

Over time more comforts were added until Los Chulengos became this remote yet sought-after estancia for travellers who want to embark on an adventure. The 100-year-old shelter has been renovated and now acts as the main lodge. Plus, there is also a house integrated in a barn which is suitable for lodging larger groups.

As for the name of the estancia, 'chulengo' refers to the baby guanaco which inhabits the Andes. It was named so because one of the owner's favourite memories was rescuing a chulengo who had lost its mother and nursing it with a bottle. That is how the estancia got the name Los Chulengos.

When it comes to activities, this estancia offers horse riding excursions that take you up into the mountain range, you can also go trekking and explore the mountain trails, and there's fly fishing on the local streams - mainly brown and rainbow trout.

One thing that sets Los Chulengos apart is that they have been breeding and raising stallions for many years, specifically, the Quarter Horse breed, known for its gentleness and docility. It's an energetic and agile horse when it comes to working with cattle.

As for food, at Los Chulengos you can expect to enjoy traditional Argentine dishes elaborated from family recipes using fresh and natural ingredients from the estancia's organic garden. Some of the specialties include empanadas baked in the clay oven, grilled beef and trout.

This estancia in Mendoza is known for breeding Texel sheep, which you can also see during your visit.

Trying the local cuisine is another important part of the estancia experience. At Los Coirones you'll get to savour dishes prepared using various traditional cooking methods like the grill, plow disc, and clay oven. And because this is Mendoza, of course, the meals are accompanied by the best wines the Uco Valley has to offer!

For me, the beauty of Cordoba is found when you leave the city behind and head up into the Sierras. These mountains are divided into two chains, the Sierras Grandes and the Sierras Chicas, the larger of the two of which is home to the highest peak in the province, Cerro Champaquí.

While you can experience the Sierras on a day trip from Cordoba, I would argue that this is a destination where it pays off to linger. Life in the mountains moves at a different rhythm, and the best way to enjoy the vast grasslands, sloping hills and golden streams is by spending a few days at one of the many estancias in Cordoba.

You can find estancias all over Argentina; you can choose from estancias in Buenos Aires for a taste of the pampas, estancias in Mendoza's wine country at the foot of the Andes mountains, and even estancias in El Calafate not too far from the glaciers! However, having spent part of my childhood in Cordoba, the Sierras are my happy place, and it's one experience that I love to recommend to others.

Few international travellers make it out to the Sierras of Cordoba, and yet there is something truly magical about the landscapes in this part of Argentina. Not to mention the wildlife; we're talking grey foxes, condors, and wild boars galore!

Plus, staying at an estancia is the perfect opportunity to learn about gaucho culture, go horseback riding and enjoy traditional cuisine! It's the quintessential Argentine experience.

So without further ado, let's take a look at some beautiful estancias in Cordoba where you can reconnect with nature. These properties range from boutique experiences with a touch of luxury to more casual guesthouses with a rugged feel.

Or if you're looking for something a bit easier, you can bring salt for the horses as a treat and try your hand at gaucho games as a fun way to end the day.

4. Arelauquen Lodge

Arelauquen Lodge is a Tribute Portfolio Hotel and another luxury Bariloche hotel for you to consider. 

The property is located in a gated neighbourhood in nearby Arelauquen Village overlooking Lake Gutierrez just southwest of Bariloche. 

We have stayed in this area on a previous visit and it's a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of Downtown Bariloche. Arelauquen is a heavily forested area so it feels far more remote than it actually is, and it's a nice nature escape. 

The views from Arelauquen Lodge are quite exceptional. They have classic guest rooms, junior suites, and family suites, and you can choose between mountain views, lake views, or golf course views.

This luxury lodge features an indoor and outdoor pool, a fitness centre and a solarium. So plenty of amenities to enjoy on site!

One important thing to note is that the lodge is separate from the Arelauquen Golf and Country Club. However, you can book a round of golf as a guest of Arelauquen Lodge. This is considered one of the best golf courses in Patagonia with 18 holes between lakes and mountains!

""The hotel is located within the Arelauquen country right in front of Lake Gutiérrez, with a beautiful view of the golf course, Cerro Catedral and the lake. Truly spectacular.

6. El Casco Art Hotel

El Casco is a 5-star boutique hotel in Bariloche dedicated to art. What makes this property unique is that it is home to over 400 masterpieces by many acclaimed Argentine artists which appear across common areas and in the guest rooms.

The art hotel has 33 rooms with 5 to 12 original works of art per room. So if you're an art connoisseur, this might just be the place for you!

This hotel houses its own on-site restaurant by the same name, El Casco, which has an ever-changing menu that is renewed during the winter and summer seasons, using fresh regional ingredients. It also has an open cellar where you can make a selection from a variety of wines to accompany your meal.

The Lobby Bar is the place to enjoy afternoon tea with lake views or get some tapas, salads, snacks and sandwiches if you start to feel peckish during the day.

Meanwhile, the spa facilities include a heated in-and-out pool, solarium, outdoor jacuzzi, dry sauna, gym and more. Guests can also book additional services like massages, and body and facial treatments.

""This is a delightful hotel a few miles outside of Bariloche. We used a taxi and it cost about £10 to get back from the town. It is set on the lake with beautiful views. The room was very comfortable with a terrace . The hotel is full of art and was quite quiet , it didn’t feel crowded. Lovely pool area and we enjoyed an afternoon sat by the pool over looking the lake. If you don’t want to eat an evening meal in the hotel there are a few restaurants within a short walking distance from the hotel . Would certainly recommend particularly if you want somewhere a little more special than the central Bariloche hotels."" -Buchanan from the United Kingdom

7. Villa Beluno

Villa Beluno is one of Bariloche's newest luxury properties, having opened its doors in 2019. 

This Italian-style villa sits atop a hill on the San Pedro Peninsula and overlooks Nahuel Huapi Lake. 

The property only has 13 rooms and is geared at travellers looking for a quiet, secluded and lavish stay.

Guests at Villa Beluno can choose from a variety of rooms including the Victoria Royal Suite, the Nahuel Huapi Master Suite, the Arrayanes Junior Suite and the Lago Quadruple Suite. All of these suites offer lake and garden views and have large windows that flood the rooms with natural light.

""We are spoiled and fussy travelers. We have been fortunate to have stayed at some wonderful places over the years - some business trips, some personal trips. I am confident that we have never stayed at a hotel as very special as the Villa Beluno. Every aspect of this hotel is terrific - wonderful common areas, terrific rooms, spectacular views from the rooms and a superb restaurant. Even the staff is the best…Juan and Sofia at the reception desk, Sofia (…our favorite waitress…) and Cristina. The reviews for this hotel probably do not do justice to this wonderful hotel. It is every bit as good as the reviews and even better…It is not inexpensive but the value is there!!!! Would love to return."" -Casey from USA

As exciting as Buenos Aires can be, sometimes all you need is a weekend escape out in nature and it's all the more enjoyable when you can find some unique accommodations to stay in.

For those unfamiliar with glamping, it's basically a more luxurious form of camping that can feature a variety of setups. 

While glamping is still a relatively new concept in Argentina (and in South America in general), there are a handful of glamping options near Buenos Aires. 

These include glamping domes, safari tents, old train cars, covered wagons, yurts, shipping containers, caravans and more. 

Most of these accommodations are a short drive from the capital city, which makes them the perfect weekend adventure.

We've done our very best to find you one-of-a-kind Buenos Aires glamping destinations, so let's check out the list!

Glamping in Buenos Aires

1. Los Vagones de Areco

Glamping in old train cars

First on this list of Buenos Aires glamping destinations is Los Vagones de Areco, one of many unique properties you can find in San Antonio de Areco. 

What makes their accommodations unique is that you can sleep in restored train wagons! So, if you grew up reading The Boxcar Children, like I did, you can experience that book series in real life.

Sleeping in train wagons may sound a bit strange, but this place is just 7 kilometres from the old Vagues Train Station (which is now a museum), hence the train connection.

Los Vagones de Areco is made up of 7 rooms, each set in a different antique train. They all include their own en suite bathrooms, feature vintage furniture and decorations, and have a small private deck.

2. Don Aniceto Lodges and Glamping

Glamping in covered wagons and domes

Don Aniceto Lodges and Glamping offers a variety of accommodation options in Carlos Keen about an hour and a half west of Buenos Aires. 

Here guests have several unusual glamping options to choose from including a colonial covered wagon that has its very own bathtub, and multiple geodesic domes with their own private bathroom and walk-in shower. 

Meanwhile, guests looking for more traditional accommodations can opt for the country suites, which feel a bit like staying at an estancia. 

The premises boast an outdoor swimming pool with sun loungers, a sun terrace and a garden area.

Glamping in geodomes

Saimon's Glamping is another option for unique accommodations on the outskirts of Buenos Aires just north of Pilar.

This property currently offers 2 geo domes in different sizes: Domo Higuera is 4 meters in diameter and best suited for couples, while Domo Fresno is 6 meters in diameter and can host up to 4 guests making it a good option for friends and families.

Both domes have their own private bathroom, a deck area and an outdoor jacuzzi. Plus the swimming pool makes it a desirable escape during the hot summer months when you want nothing more than to get out of the city!

While there is no kitchen inside the geo domes, breakfast is served daily and each dome has a mini fridge and an outdoor barbecue area for grilling and dining al fresco - part of the Argentine tradition!

Additional services like massages, yoga and reflexology can also be booked for guests looking to relax and unwind.

Domes at Saimon's Glamping can be booked via email or Instagram direct message.

4. Terranova Glamping

Glamping in safari tents

Terranova Glamping is a unique property because their glamping tents are located within the grounds of the Wyndham Garden Luján Resort. This glamping site is set in the outskirts of Luján just 1 hour west of Buenos Aires.

This fun glamping experience seeks to combine nature, luxury and comfort for those who want to sleep under the stars without roughing it! The idea is to bring the hotel experience outdoors. 

Guests at Terranova Glamping can choose between two types of tents: the Terranova Classic tent or the Terranova Superior luxury tent. Both tents are exactly the same size, 5 meters in diameter and can each fit up to 4 guests. The main difference is that Terranova Classic has shared bathrooms just a few meters from the tent, while Terranove Superior offers private bathrooms.

The Terranova Glamping sites offer full room and board, so that means 4 meals per day: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. Yes, in Argentina you typically get 4 meals per day!

As far as activities at Terranova Glamping go, you'll be happy to hear that there's plenty to do! You can play tennis, fútbol, volleyball, ping pong, join a 30-minute horse trek, enjoy the pool (which is heated and covered!), or roast marshmallows over the fire pit.

They also have an on-site spa, though those services are extra. All this to say that you can plan your glamping getaway to be as relaxing or as active as you want!

5. Los Furgones de Areco

Glamping in old caravans

Another unusual Buenos Aires glamping experience can be found at Los Furgones de Areco. This property is located on the outskirts of San Antonio de Areco, Argentina's famous gaucho town.

First, let's talk about the name. A furgón or furgoneta is a type of vehicle that's smaller than a truck but bigger than a car. It's typically used to transport goods and make small deliveries, and it's very popular all over Argentina.

Well, at Los Furgones de Areco, they've taken these old vehicles and mounted a caravan on the back resulting in a rather unique accommodation option.

They have a few different caravans to choose from all centred around a lagoon.

This is a more rustic glamping experience; bathrooms are located outdoors (you'll want to bring a flashlight!) and the electricity inside the caravan is solar-powered so it's low voltage. However, if you're looking to disconnect, this place offers precisely that!

6. Alterra Pinamar

Glamping in shipping containers

Alterra Pinamar is a glamping experience set in the seaside resort town of Pinamar on the Atlantic Coast. It is the furthest Buenos Aires glamping site on this list and it is a 4-hour drive from the capital city. 

The four shipping containers at Alterra Pinamar have been transformed into sustainable holiday apartments in a natural setting. 

Guests can choose between the Turquoise Eco Apartment for 4, the Red Eco Apartment for 4, the Black Eco Apartment for 5, or the Green Eco Apartment for 2. 

All of the holiday apartments use LEDs for low energy consumption and have thermal insulation to help maintain the temperature inside the space. 

They also have free WiFi, a private terrace and access to the swimming pool.

Like with most coastal resort towns in Argentina, this is a seasonal property that does shut down during low season, so you'll want to check availability.

7. Yamay Ecotourism

Glamping in yurts

Yamay Ecotourism is a glamping experience set in the outskirts of Pardo, a small community located three and a half hours southwest of Buenos Aires. 

The name yamay means 'to be well' in the native Mapuche language. 

At Yamay Ecotourism guests can stay in yurts for a taste of Central Asia. There are 4 yurts to choose from: Wara, Kimah, Mañic and Maimará Luz. These can fit anywhere between 2 to 8 guests. 

The yurts feature wooden floors, an outdoor deck with a seating area, a skylight for stargazing, a private bathroom, and a collection of books and board games for entertainment. 

This glamping stay is set in a rural area and the goal is rest, relaxation and enjoying the natural surroundings. 

They also offer an eco-camping option for guests who would rather bring their own tents and camp out on the property.

Glamping in Buenos Aires: Know Before You Go

Some glamping experiences are seasonal.

While many of the properties on this list are open year-round, some close during the winter months. This is because they're either set in summer resort towns that shut down after the summer holidays, or because they don't have adequate heating to run the experience during the cooler months. Be mindful of this if you're looking beyond Buenos Aires, like some glamping camps in El Chalten and other glamping experiences in Patagonia.

Pack for the weather. 

Again, while some glamping spots have air conditioning and heating, others do not. Pack warm layers, especially if you're planning to stay during the spring/autumn shoulder season when the temperatures can drop overnight. And if you're visiting during the summer months, choose a place with a swimming pool as it gets hot around these parts!

You'll likely need to rent a car. 

While most glamping sites are just a short distance from Buenos Aires, the majority are in rural settings which makes them difficult to access using only public transportation. Renting a vehicle is your best option, plus this also gives you the ability to explore the surrounding area.

Self-catered versus full room and board.

Not all glamping stays are created equal! Some properties include 4 meals a day, some only include breakfast, and others are entirely self-catered experiences that require you to bring your own food for the duration of your stay. Read through the kitchen amenities as some places have no indoor kitchen, but rather an outdoor grill.

Estancias can be a great alternative.

The truth is, Argentine food can feel overwhelming at first glance. You sit down at a parrilla and suddenly you’re staring at a list of cuts you’ve never heard of, regional empanada styles you didn’t know existed, and stews whose names don’t give away what’s inside. On top of that, there are all the pastries, pastas, Andean dishes, and Patagonian specialties that rarely make it onto basic “what to eat in Argentina” lists.

Well, I've not only lived in Argentina, but also spent months travelling the length of the country, so this blog post is basically the greatest hits playlist of everything I’d recommend to friends. I’ll walk you through classic Argentine dishes, regional comfort foods, vegetarian-friendly options, desserts, and drinks, with plenty of ideas you can look out for on menus, food tours, and local markets.

This is your handy checklist of foods to try in Argentina so you don’t leave thinking, “I wish I’d known about that.” You won’t be able to try everything in one trip (though you’re welcome to try!), but with this guide in hand, you’ll know exactly which dishes to hunt down.

Argentine Breakfast Pastries & Baked Goods

Mornings in Argentina start with something sweet. Locals usually pair a coffee with either a pastry or bread slathered in dulce de leche, so if you have a sweet tooth, you'll be pleased by all the options.

Medialunas

Medialunas are these sweet croissants that are smaller and plumper than their French cousins. They are a staple of an Argentine breakfast and my favourite way to start the day! You can order them “de manteca” (buttery) or “de grasa” (made with lard). I have a preference for the sweet kind, but it's worth trying both. Find a café that serves café con leche with a side of 3 medialunas and you're golden!

Facturas

Facturas is an umbrella term for a wide variety of pastries topped with cream, dulce de leche, or jam. You can have them at breakfast or during your midafternoon snack, known as merienda. Some of my favourites are cañoncitos, or little cannons, stuffed with dulce de leche; the rejillas, topped with quince jam; and moñitos, which are bow-shaped and have custard on one side and quince on the other.

Masas finas

Masas finas are these beautiful bite-sized pastries, often filled with dulce de leche, fruit jam, or chocolate ganache. You can buy them by the weight, and it's what I like to bring if I'm invited to a birthday, afternoon tea, or family gathering. They are always a hit!

Alfajores

Alfajores are another Argentine food to try, especially if you have a sweet tooth! This sweet treat consists of two soft sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche and coated in chocolate. There are endless variations across the country; where we live in the Province of Cordoba, jam-filled alfajores covered in a sugar glaze are the local specialty. 

Tortas fritas

Tortas fritas are a roadside staple and consist of plain fried dough pastries that you can enjoy with mate. Think of it as a salty donut. I first tried these in Patagonia on our Seven Lakes tour; I remember it was cold, I was hungry, and I lined up with tourists for a fried treat that raised my spirits.

Bizcochitos de grasa

Bizcochitos de grasa are these small savoury pastries made with lard. In Cordoba Province, we call them criollitos and they are layered, so you can pull them apart as you eat them. You can enjoy them alongside your morning coffee or with mate. 

Pastelitos 

Pastelitos are layered pastries filled with either quince paste (membrillo) or batata (sweet potato) and dipped in syrup. Personally, I'm on team batata, but it's worth trying both. These pastries are traditionally eaten on national holidays like 25 de Mayo, to commemorate the May Revolution.

Budín

Budín is a sweet loaf cake that is served at breakfast or for merienda as an afternoon snack. It can be in various flavours like vanilla, lemon or chocolate marble known as marmolado. Sometimes it has a sugar or chocolate glaze on top, and it goes great with coffee.

Pan casero 

Another food item you're bound to come across at your local bakery or corner store is pan casero or pan de campo. This is a rustic country bread that is perfect for slathering jams or soft cheese. This is another option for a sweet breakfast. 

Dulce de leche 

Have you even travelled to Argentina if you haven't tried dulce de leche? This caramel-like spread is Argentina’s pride and makes an appearance in almost every dessert. You can spread it on bread, add a dollop to your ice cream, use it as a cake filling, or just eat it by the spoonful; the latter is precisely what happened when I first introduced my in-laws to dulce de leche! 

Argentine Snacks, Street Food & Picadas

Mid-day hunger in Argentina usually means grabbing a quick sandwich, sharing a picada, or stopping by a street stand.

Picada 

Picada isn't one particular dish, but rather, an assorted snacking platter with cheeses, cured meats, olives, peanuts, bread and anything else you want to get creative with. I like to have this as a light dinner option, and it's something that you can actually order in many restaurants, not just make at home. 

Empanadas 

Empanadas are a must-try food in Argentina, and they are something you will find on almost every restaurant menu! They are stuffed savoury pastries that can be either baked or fried, and their fillings vary regionally. Beef empanadas are a classic, but keep an eye out for humita (corn), jamón y queso (ham and cheese), and capresa (mozzarella, tomatoes and basil). My favourite empanadas are the beef ones sweetened with raisins, and I also think frying them elevates the flavour!

Lomito

Lomito is a thin tenderloin steak sandwich that is piled high with lettuce, tomato, ham, cheese, and a fried egg on fluffy bread that can absorb all the juices. The end result is a sky-high sandwich that is a little tricky to bite into! It's especially popular in Córdoba, and that's where I tried it for the first time.

Milanesa

The milanesa is Argentina’s version of a schnitzel. It is a breaded, fried cutlet usually made from veal. It’s served with a side of mashed potatoes, fries, or tucked into a sandwich.

Suprema de Pollo

The suprema de pollo is a chicken breast lightly breaded and fried until golden, and it's an alternative to the country’s beloved milanesa. I personally prefer the chicken milanesa and it's my go-to order when I eat at a bodegón. 

Sánguche de milanesa 

The milanesa sandwich is a really popular lunch on the go. You're basically just taking the classic milanesa and slapping it inside a bun with a bit of mayonnaise. I often see it for sale at empanada shops or corner stores.

Papas fritas a caballo 

Papas fritas al caballo is a plate of French fries topped with two fried eggs. Anytime that you see al caballo on the menu, it means 'on horseback' and it refers to two fried eggs on top. It's something that makes an appearance on many dishes, from fries to steaks to milanesas.

Pizza 

I know, I know, you're going to tell me pizza is Italian, but think about all the Italian immigration to Argentina! All you have to do is walk down Avenida Corrientes and you're going to stumble upon one pizzeria after the next. The best part is that most pizzerias have a selection that you can order by the slice, so you can try all sorts of toppings! I'm a big fan of the cheeseless pizza con anchoas, which only has tomato sauce and anchovies.

Fugazza / Fugazetta

Since we're on the topic of pizza, I also want to mention two types of pizza that have been popularized in Argentina. Fugazza is the Genoese word for focaccia, and it consists of a cheeseless dough topped with onions. Then, you have the fugazetta, which takes the fugazza and stuffs it with copious amounts of cheese.

Fainá 

Continuing with the pizza talk, I can't skip over fainá, which is not pizza, but it is eaten with pizza! This is a chickpea flatbread that is typically served on top of a pizza slice. It's a quirky but beloved combo that is often sliced into random shapes; I've never understood why it's not sliced into the perfect pizza triangle, but I digress.

Chipá 

Chipá is technically from Paraguay, but it's so popular in Argentina that you can buy it in any bakery. It is a cheese bread that uses mandioca or cassava flour, which gives the dough a nice chewiness. I usually buy a dozen of these when I'm out running errands in town, and sometimes I finish the whole thing before I get home. They are so good, it's hard to stop!

Argentine Meat & Parrilla Classics

If Argentina has a religion, it’s asado. Grilling meat is an art form, and sitting around the parrilla with friends and family is a ritual.

Asado

Asado is an Argentine barbecue featuring a wide variety of grilled meat. However, it's important to note that it's not just about the food; this is an experience meant to be shared with family and friends, and it's a social event that can last the better part of the day. Some classic Argentine cuts of meat to look out for include bife de chorizo (strip steak), lomo (tenderloin), entraña (skirt steak), and tira de asado (ribs).

Provoleta

Why am I including cheese in the BBQ section? Because it's a quintessential part of the asado experience! At an Argentine asado, you'll notice a small cast-iron pan that fits a thick, round slice of provoleta cheese. It's served as an appetizer, all melted and gooey with a little sprinkling of dry oregano.

Choripán 

A choripán consists of a chorizo on a bun topped with chimichurri, and it's a crucial part of an Argentine asado. This is what you typically eat first, while the other cuts of meat cook slowly. It can also be a meal in and of itself. In Buenos Aires, you can find food trucks along the Costanera that serve up choripán, and it's the perfect meal on the go.

Morcilla 

Morcilla is one of those divisive Argentine foods that people either love or hate. It's a blood sausage, usually served early in the asado. You typically take the filling and spread it on bread. I used to love eating this as a child, but it's different once you know the ingredient!

Mollejas

Mollejas are another divisive food item that appears in an Argentine BBQ. These are the sweetbreads, which are grilled until golden and served with a squeeze of lemon juice.

Chinchulines

Chinchulines are grilled small intestines, and again, it's one of those foods that some people love and others refuse to try. They are cooked until crispy. 

Matambre

Matambre is a very thin cut of meat, similar to the flank steak. You'll often see it served as matambre arrollado, where it is rolled with vegetables and eggs, and then boiled or roasted. The name matambre means ""hunger killer"".

Bondiola 

Bondiola refers to pork shoulder, slow-cooked over coals, and it's often served in a sandwich. It's a popular street food snack that rivals the choripán, and as such, it is nicknamed the bondipán.

Cordero patagónico 

Cordero patagónico is slow-roasted Patagonian lamb cooked over an open fire, and it is especially famous in southern Patagonia. This is a dish that you're going to encounter over and over again. Many restaurants will have a Sunday BBQ where they serve Patagonian lamb, and we also had this when we did an estancia stay at Tecka Lodge.

Chivito / Cabrito

Chivito or cabrito refers to goat meat, and it is especially popular in Córdoba and Cuyo. It's grilled on the stake over an open fire, much like the Patagonian lamb. This is something you'll encounter if you're invited to a family barbecue.

Llama meat 

Llama meat is a food that's a bit more common in the northwest part of the country (think Salta and Jujuy). Locally known as carne de llama, the meat is very lean and often served as steaks, skewers or in stews.

Pollo al disco

Pollo al disco translates to 'chicken in the disc' and it's a dish where the chicken is cooked in a plough-disk pan. It's a dish that has its roots in the rural areas of Buenos Aires province, where using agricultural equipment for cooking was convenient!

Chimichurri

Lastly, all of this meat is served with a spoonful of chimichurri. This is a type of meat dressing made with parsley, chilli peppers, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and vinegar. You'll often find a little plate or jar with this sauce at the table.

Salsa criolla

Like chimichurri, salsa criolla also makes an appearance at any barbecue meal. It consists of chopped tomatoes, onions and red peppers with olive oil and vinegar. You may be inclined to compare it to a pico de gallo, but it's not quite the same. I usually eat it with bread before the meat even arrives, though technically it's meant to go with the meat.

Tip: If you want to delve deeper into Argentina's asado culture, you need to attend the Fiesta Nacional del Asado or the National BBQ Fest, held in Cholila!

Traditional Argentine Stews & Andean Dishes

Hearty stews and casseroles are quite abundant in Argentine cuisine and especially popular during the cooler winter months. 

Guiso de lentejas 

When it comes to traditional Argentine food from the northern part of the country, guiso de lentejas is my absolute favourite! This is a lentil stew with chorizo and bacon, and it is typically served in a clay pot. It's a very hearty and filling meal, especially during the cooler months, though I'm perfectly happy to eat it year-round!

Puchero 

Puchero is a stew that combines an assortment of meats (beef, chicken, sausage, bone marrow) and vegetables (potatoes, sweet potato, carrots, corn, onions). This is comfort food at its finest, and it's served once the temperatures start to drop.

Locro 

Locro is a corn, meat, bean and vegetable stew that's eaten on national holidays. No two locro recipes are the same, but most traditional recipes include a combination of sausage, bacon, tripe, and pig feet! Locro is a dish you can find year-round in the northern provinces, but you can also try it in Buenos Aires if you go to a restaurant that specializes in northern dishes.

Carbonada criolla 

Carbonada criolla is a type of beef stew made with corn, squash, and dried fruit, which adds a little bit of sweetness to the dish. The traditional way to serve this dish is in a baked pumpkin, though you can also get it in a clay pot.

Guiso de cazador

Guiso de cazador is a hunter’s stew and it's eaten a lot in Patagonia. The dish features tender chunks of venison simmered slowly with vegetables, red wine, and herbs.

Guiso de jabalí

Guiso de jabalí is a Patagonian stew made with wild boar. It is slow-cooked, blending the meat with red wine, root vegetables, and local herbs. It’s earthy, hearty, and a favourite in mountain lodges during the colder months.

Tamales 

Tamales can be found across Latin America, so they are not uniquely Argentine, however, they are eaten in the northwestern part of the country. The dish consists of corn flour stuffed with meat and steamed in a corn husk.

Humita 

Then you have the humita, which is similar to the tamal, but not quite the same. The humita is made with fresh corn that's blended into a paste. It is also wrapped in a corn husk (humitas en chala), and it either has a cheese filling or no filling at all.

Polenta 

Another Argentine food to try is polenta! The dish consists of cornmeal that is either cooked soft or firm, and topped with tomato sauce and cheese. I prefer it soft so that I can eat it with a spoon. I loved eating it as a kid, and I love eating it now. They sell instant polenta at the supermarkets, so it's something that you can buy and make yourself.

Pastel de papa

Pastel de papa is a potato pie, similar to shepherd’s pie. It consists of a seasoned ground beef layer on the bottom and a mashed potato layer on top (though in my family, we do potato-meat-potato so that it holds its shape better). It's a classic baked casserole dish for the winter months when your body is craving something warm and filling.

Tarta Pascualina / Tarta de Acelga 

If you enjoy savoury tarts, you'll want to try tarta pascualina. This tart has Swiss chard, eggs, onions and ricotta. It's especially popular for Easter, though at my house, we eat it year-round.

Argentine Pasta & Italian-Inspired Dishes

Thanks to waves of Italian immigration, pasta has become a Sunday tradition in many Argentine households. It’s hearty, comforting, and often smothered in tuco, a tomato and meat sauce.

Ñoquis 

Ñoquis or gnocchi is a pasta-like dumpling, and in Argentina, it is typically eaten on the 29th of each month for good luck. Fun fact: ñoqui is also a slang term for an Argentine government worker who receives a monthly wage but performs little to no work. They are called ñoquis because they show up on the 29th to collect their paychecks!

Sorrentinos 

This is one dish where you can see the influence of Italian immigration in Argentina, particularly from Sorrento. A sorrentino is a round pasta, similar to a ravioli, and it is stuffed with ham and cheese. It's one of the more popular pasta dishes you're likely to find on a menu.

Fideos con tuco 

Fideos or tallarines refer to noodles, and tuco to the rich tomato sauce that goes with them. When you order this dish, you'll typically get spaghetti, linguine or fettuccine. Load them with a couple of spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese, and you're set!

Canelones

Canelones are rolled pasta tubes that are filled with ricotta, spinach, or meat. In Argentina, you'll often eat this dish with pancake rolls (think thin crepes) instead of the classic pasta tubes. It can be served with a tomato or bechamel sauce.

Argentine Seafood Dishes

Argentina isn’t well known for seafood, but Patagonia’s coast and lakes mean ample opportunity to try crab, trout, prawns and more!

Centolla 

Centolla or king crab is a local specialty in Ushuaia. The meat is tender with a hint of sweetness, and it’s similar to lobster in terms of texture. My favourite way to eat centolla is al disco, meaning cooked in a plough or deep dish.

Cazuela de mariscos 

Cazuela de mariscos is a seafood stew loaded with shrimp, mussels, and fish. This is a popular dish in coastal areas, and we had one of our best meals at a beachside restaurant in Comodoro Rivadavia. What I love about this dish is the variety of seafood packed into one single dish!

Rabas 

Rabas are fried calamari rings, crunchy and perfect with lemon. It's a dish that you can enjoy fresh in many coastal cities in Argentina. When I think of eating rabas, I picture the restaurant that sits on the Muelle de Pescadores in Mar del Plata. There's just something about enjoying seafood on a pier with the fresh ocean breeze blowing in your hair.

Trucha 

Patagonian trout or trucha thrives in Argentina’s crystal-clear mountain lakes and rivers. You can try it grilled simply with lemon or served in creamy sauces. I tried a trout dish with a creamy leek and almond sauce in Patagonia, and it was divine!

Argentine Desserts & Sweet Treats

When it comes to Argentine desserts, dulce de leche reigns supreme, plus you’ll find plenty of regional cakes, puddings, and frozen delights.

Flan 

There is no Argentine dessert more iconic than flan! This silky custard is creamy and smooth, and in Argentina, it is served with dulce de leche, whipped cream, or both, known as flan mixto.

Panqueques con dulce de leche

Picture a thin crêpe stuffed with dulce the leche with a light dusting of icing sugar on top. You cut into it, and the caramel spread oozes out! This dessert is for those with a major sweet tooth, and it makes an appearance at almost every restaurant.

Torta Rogel

Torta Rogel is a mille-feuille cake with layers of crispy pastry with dulce de leche in between. The whole cake is then coated in meringue. It is very sweet, almost overwhelmingly so, so I would say this is one to share!

Helado artesanal 

Argentina loves its ice cream, and excels when it comes to artisanal ice cream! I would suggest trying anything dulce de leche flavoured, as it's what Argentina is best known for, and if you're travelling in Patagonia, opt for a cream-based ice cream with frutos del bosque or forest berries.

Pasta frola

Pasta frola is a sweet tart made with quince paste and a lattice design on top. It can be enjoyed as a dessert or at merienda time. This is one of my favourite Argentine desserts; I like the crumbly dough and the tartness of the quince.

Postre Vigilante 

Take a slice of quince paste and plop it on top of a slice of cheese and you have queso y dulce, also known as postre vigilante. It's a super simple and traditional dish that involves no effort to serve, and it's a classic that appears in most bodegón restaurants. You can also get a variation with sweet potato paste.

Arroz con leche 

Arroz con leche is a dish that was brought over to Argentina during Spanish colonization, but it's become a part of Argentina's culinary identity. It is a creamy milk and rice pudding dusted with cinnamon. I really like the variety with orange zest. 

Mazamorra

Mazamorra is another traditional Argentine dish that is eaten during national holidays, and it is a pudding made with white maize, water, sugar, and vanilla. Sometimes, it's served together with arroz con leche. 

Chocolate artesanal

Artisanal chocolate is a big deal in Patagonia, and just to give you an example, in Bariloche, you can't go more than a few blocks without coming across a chocolatería. The best part is that you can buy chocolate by the weight, so you can go into a chocolate shop, choose the box size you want, and then get an assortment of flavours. Some of my favourites include milk chocolate with cereal, coconut, and raspberry.

Torta Negra

Torta negra is a dark, dense Welsh cake made with dried fruits, spices, and a touch of brandy. It is eaten in areas with Welsh heritage, such as Gaiman and Trevelin, and pairs perfectly with afternoon tea.

Mantecol

Mantecol is a soft peanut nougat that is popular around the holidays. In terms of flavour, it's somewhere between halva and peanut butter, and it comes in a candy bar shape.

Pan dulce

Pan dulce, also known as panetón, is a type of sweet bread with candied fruits that is typically eaten around the Christmas holidays. It was originally brought over from Italy, where it is known as panettone, by Lombard immigrants. I'm not really a huge fan of the candied fruit variety, however, I do like the version with chocolate chips!

Turrón

Turrón is another holiday favourite in Argentina. This is a nougat confection made with honey, sugar, egg whites, and toasted almonds. I find that it can be quite chewy, so eat it with care, especially if you have fillings!

Calafate berries

Calafate berries are tiny purple berries native to southern Patagonia, and eating them is said to guarantee your return to Patagonia. Obviously, we ate them on our first trip to Patagonia, and we've since returned almost annually, so there may be some truth in that! They are sweet yet tart and used in jams, liqueurs, and ice creams across the region.

Pionono

Pionono is a sheet of sponge cake rolled to resemble a log shape. It is filled with dulce de leche and then sliced so that each portion looks like a roll. While the dessert version is the most popular, you can also choose to make it savoury by stuffing it with ham, cheese, veggies and some mayonnaise.

Postre Balcarce

Postre Balcarce originated in the city of Balcarce in the Province of Buenos Aires. It consists of a sponge cake layered with dulce de leche, whipped cream, meringue, praline and nuts. The exterior is then coated with cream and crumbled meringue. This is considered a bit of a fancy cake for special occasions, so you're likely to spot it at a party or a wedding.

Chocotorta 

If you want a cake, but you don't want to bake, then the answer is chocotorta! This cake is made by taking chocolate cookies, soaking them in milk, and then placing them in a tray with layers of dulce de leche and cream cheese in between. The whole thing then goes in the fridge, and you've got a super easy dessert kids love at birthday parties.

Ensalada de Frutas

Ensalada de frutas is a refreshing mix of seasonal fruits, and it is served chilled with a splash of orange juice and Sprite. It’s a light dish to finish Argentina’s famously heavy meals, and it's especially popular in summer.

Chajá

Chajá is a sponge cake dessert with meringue and peaches, and while it's technically from our Uruguayan neighbours, it also makes an appearance in Argentine cuisine. It's light, fluffy and refreshing.

Drinks to Try in Argentina

Last, but not least, let's talk about drinks! There is a lot to try from herbal infusions to medicinal liqueurs, and wines to craft beers!

Mate

Mate is a herbal infusion that's served in a gourd and drunk with a metal straw known as a bombilla. Learning to drink mate is a cultural initiation and a crucial part of any trip to Argentina! Don't be surprised if your tour guide offers you mate! It is a drink that is meant to be shared among friends. You can also buy mate cocido in tea bags, if you want to enjoy the taste without the ceremonial preparation. Don't forget to buy a mate gourd, bombilla and pack of yerba mate to take home as one of your many Argentina souvenirs.

Sidra 

Sidra is a sparkling cider made with fermented apple juice. It is typically enjoyed during the holidays, so if you're spending Christmas or New Year's Eve in Argentina, you'll toast with cider at midnight! Sidra Real is a classic, and it brings back lots of memories of late summer nights filled with festivities.

Fernet con Coca 

Fernet is a bitter liqueur of Italian origin made with various medicinal herbs. It is typically served as a digestif, and in Córdoba, they love to serve it with Coca-Cola, also known as fernet con coca or Fernandito! Because fernet is an acquired taste, it's made more palatable by the addition of Coke, so it's a good way to try it for the first time.

Vino 

Argentina is one of the world’s top wine producers, so of course you'll want to sample the wines! Each region is known for different grape varietals. I recommend trying Malbec in Mendoza, Torrontés in Cafayate, and Pinot Noir in Patagonia. If you only have time for one region, fly down to Mendoza, stay at one of the wine hotels, and spend your day vineyard hopping.

Submarino 

The name submarino translates to 'submarine' and it's a favourite with kids. I remember wanting to have this drink as a child growing up in Argentina! It basically consists of a chocolate bar that is dropped into a glass of hot milk, melting slowly as you stir it around your cup. It's especially popular during the cooler winter months.

Cerveza artesanal 

If you're planning to travel around Patagonia, you're going to discover that this part of Argentina loves its craft beer! The cool climate is great for growing hops, so that means lots of breweries, especially in and around Bariloche. You'll find everything from Porter to Pilsen and Lager to IPA. I like their raspberry beer, so that's one to try if you want to go for something fruity.

Licor de dulce de leche

You can buy all sorts of licores or liqueurs in Argentina, and one of the most popular flavours is dulce de leche. This is typically found in artisanal souvenir shops, and it's something that I tend to stock up on for gifts. Other flavours to look out for include coffee, chocolate, white chocolate, raspberries, and cherry, to name a few.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,2e4bcda1ffb90a85029bebce6b878c030cc93510

If I had to summarize San Carlos de Bariloche in three words, I would say mountains, chocolate and craft beer. Today, we're going to focus on the latter.

Argentina may be known as the Land of Wine, with Malbec as the grape of choice, however, in Patagonia, beer is king. 

So why is beer so popular in Bariloche?

It's the combination of the cool climate, an abundant supply of fresh water, and the locally harvested hops that go into the creation of craft beer. 

This has given rise to numerous breweries and brewpubs in and around Bariloche, meaning you never have to travel too far to quench your thirst with a pint of beer. 

Whether you're craving a Pilsen or a Porter, a Lager or an IPA, you can find it here. Plus, you can even try some more creative beers made with raspberry, pumpkin and hot chillies!

In this guide, we're going to share some of the best Bariloche breweries to drink craft beer!

🍺 Don't have time to visit all these breweries? The Bariloche Beer Experience takes you to 3 breweries for guided tours and tastings, including regional food. It's one of the top-rated food and drink experiences! 

How to order beer in Argentina

First things first, some vocabulary. Before we dive into Bariloche's beer scene, here are some useful Spanish words when it comes to ordering beer:

Cerveza - beerCerveza artesanal - craft beerCervecería - breweryChop - mug (330mL)Pinta - pint (500mL)Jarra - jug (1.5 Liters)

Tip: A lot of the cervecerías in Bariloche do happy hour where you can get 2-for-1 beers. This is a good option if you're looking to try a few different brews and you're on a budget. 

Bariloche Breweries: Where to Drink Beer

Because we've visited Bariloche multiple times over the years, we've had the opportunity to visit many of the breweries in and around the city. 

Some we've gone back to multiple times because we are creatures of habit. I'm looking at you Cervecería Patagonia, Gilbert and Manush - these are three of our personal favourites! 

Then there are other breweries that we haven't necessarily visited in person, but we've had a chance to try the beers at different establishments around town.

Plus, there are plenty of breweries that we have yet to visit since there are new ones constantly popping up!

Patagonia

Cervecería Patagonia is the most famous brewery in Bariloche. If you were visiting Bariloche for the first time, I would bring you to this brewery for a classic experience.

Aside from being a well-established name in the microbrewing circuit, it has an incredible location on the Circuito Chico with truly stunning views.

The brewery overlooks Lago Moreno and as you enter the premises, you go past a hops plantation and a lavender field, before being met with various drinking and dining options.

You have an outdoor beer garden, main salon, outdoor terrace, domes, plus outdoor picnic tables and chairs at the various lookout points. I love coming here for the views! It's a beautiful space, but it's no well-kept secret so expect it to be busy.

The beer selection includes Amber Lager, Bohemian Pilsner, Pale Ale, Weisse, Porter, IPA and Double IPA, just to name a few.

As for the menu, they've got lots of snacking platters, sandwiches, hamburgers, and traditional Patagonian dishes. 

Cervecería Patagonia offers two types of beer tours. You can join a 1 hour and 30-minute tasting where you sample 4 of their beers, or you can sign up for a 2 hour and 15-minute meal featuring 3 courses with beer pairings. Both tours can be booked here.

Address: Kilometre 24.7 Circuito Chico, Bariloche 

Gilbert

Cervecería Gilbert is one of my favourite breweries in Bariloche and one that I would select for some hearty Patagonian dishes paired with great craft beer.

Gilbert is also located on the Circuito Chico, but it's down a side road, so it doesn't get an overwhelming number of visitors.

This brewery is set in a cozy log cabin, features rustic wood furniture, and the decor consists of old beer bottles from every place imaginable. 

When it comes to food, the specialty at Gilbert is cheese fondue for two. You get 3 different types of cheese: Gruyere, Fontina and Pategras and then you get small plates with bread, potatoes, sausage, carrots, apples and pickles for dipping. 

They also have local dishes on the menu, which around these parts means German food! You can get Goulash with Spaetzle, or a German sausage platter with sauerkraut, potatoes, apple chutney and mustard. Their wild boar stew and deer stew are two local classics.

All this to say, the food options are beyond tempting and I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.

Gilbert's beers on tap include Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Kölsch, Scottish and American IPA. 

Address: Kilometre 24, Circuito Chico, Bariloche

Manush

Cervecería Manush is another well-known Bariloche brewery with two different locations. Their Centro location is right downtown and super easy to reach and the other one is located at Kilometro 4 just as you head west out of Bariloche.

I've had the opportunity to eat and drink at both locations and can highly recommend both spots for great beer and delicious food!

The specialty at Manush is gourmet burgers. Their Big Manush features an extra large beef patty, onions sauteed in black beer, double cheddar, Irish sauce, aioli and lettuce all served on a brioche bun with a side of thick-cut fries.

Some of the beers on tap at Manush include Honey, Irish Cream Ale, Milk Stout and IPA Black. They have multiple award-winning beers on tap, so maybe consider ordering a flight of beers so you can sample a bit of everything. 

Their beer flight includes 4 100mL beers; if you're still thirsty, you can always order a pint of your favourite afterwards!

Berlina

Cervecería Berlina is one of the pioneers in Bariloche's craft beer scene.

Also known as Berlina Patagonia Brewery, this microbrewery is the work of three brothers: Franco, Guido and Bruno Ferrari.

In 2004, they opened a brewpub in Bariloche and later in 2008 they moved their production to Colonia Suiza. Their brewery is located at the edge of town at the corner of Calle Felix Goye and Ruta 79. It's a very popular spot with day visitors.

Berlina has won many awards including 'Best Craft Brewery in Argentina' in 2017 and 'Second Best Brewery in South America' that same year.

They elaborate 30 types of beers per year including a few seasonal and limited edition beers. Some fun ones to try include Chocolate Imperial Stout, American Pale Ale, Hefeweizen and Pumpkin Ale.

Address: Colonia Suiza and Kilometro 12

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cervecería Kunstmann Argentina (@kunstmann_ar)

Kunstmann

Kunstmann is a brewery with German-Chilean roots produced in Valdivia, Chile. During the early years of the German colonization in southern Chile, Carlos Anwandter became one of the first brewers in the area opening Cervecería Anwandter in 1851.

However, when the 1960 Valdivia earthquake hit, it destroyed the Anwandter Brewery and also decimated the brewing industry in the region. It wasn't until 1985, that the Kunstamann family started experimenting with beer production and by 1991, they had released their first lager. 

But why are we talking about a Chilean brewery, you might be asking yourself? Because Kunstamann is one of the oldest breweries in Patagonia and they have a brewpub in Bariloche which is perfectly situated overlooking Lago Nahuel Huapi! 

They have 5 craft beers on their menu: Lager, Torobayo, Gran Torobayo, Bock and Session IPA. 

Address: Avenida Exequiel Bustillo 7966, Bariloche

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gennow Cerveza Artesanal (@gennowcerveza)

Gennow

Gennow is a craft brewery that started in the mountain town of El Bolsón - which we love so much! - but has since expanded to Bariloche.

They have some light, fruity beers which are quite nice on a hot summer day including raspberry, cherry, and blackcurrant beer.

For something a bit more experimental, they have a hot chilli beer!

Gennow is known for its experimental artisanal beers, so if you're looking to try something different, you know where to go.

Update: Gennow recently closed its tap room in Bariloche, however, you can still sample their beers in various bars and restaurants across town. Plus, you can also find their beers for sale at local shops.

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Blest Bariloche (@cerveceriablestkm4)

Blest

You could say that Blest beer was born on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi. After all, it gets its name 'Blest' from the lake's western arm which almost reaches the border with Chile.

The origins of Club Cervecero Blest, or Blest Beer Club, go back to 1989 when Nicolás Silin and Julio Migoya decided to start experimenting with homemade beer. The Bariloche craft beer scene hadn't yet taken off and most of the beer options were industrial.

So what sorts of beers can you expect to find here?

Blest currently produces 13 different types of craft beers: Scotch, IPA, Pilsen, Honey, APA, Bock, Black IPA, Barley Wine, Framboise, Sidra, Stout, NEIPA, and Red IPA.

They also have multiple taprooms across Argentina - including some places we have visited like Villa La Angostura, Esquel, and Trelew - as well as multiple locations in the city of Buenos Aires.

Address: Avenida Exequiel Bustillo 3850 Km4, Bariloche

Wesley

Wesley Brewery started out in the 1950s as a fun hobby for Teddy Wesley, a World War II veteran who settled in Patagonia and set up his farm on the outskirts of Bariloche.

It was on his farm that he started experimenting with the homemade production of liquors, ciders and beer using regional products.

When Teddy's grandchildren found his brewing instruments and recipes sixty years later, the idea for Wesley's Brewery was born.Today, this family microbrewery is run out of Teddy's old farm, where the beers are made using some of the purest water in the Cordillera, which comes from the slopes of Cerro Campanario, and fresh hops from the Andean region.

Wesley Brewery is committed to the environment focusing on responsible energy consumption and reusing by-products which are 100% destined to feed the farm's animals.

Some of the craft beers at Wesley Brewery include Golden Ale, Honey, NEIPA, APA, IPA, Hazy Session IPA, Scottish and Porter.

They also have a Belgian beer series featuring Belgian Dark Strong, Trippel and Dubbel.

Address: Brewery - Avenida Exequiel Bustillo 15500 / Downtown Pub - 20 de Febrero 451 Casa 1

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cerveceria Lowther Bariloche (@cervecerialowtherbariloche)

Lowther

Cervecería Lowther is another option for craft beer in Bariloche. This brewery was started by Ricardo “El Gringo” Lowther and has recently opened a second location in neighbouring Dina Huapi.

The beers include Porter, Milk Stout, Irish Cream Ale, American Amber Ale, Honey, American Pale Ale, Indian Pale Ale Double IPA, and of course, the beloved Raspberry beer you can find across Patagonia. 

Aside from beer, Lowther has recently started dabbling with gin production, which seems to be the next big hit in Bariloche. You can buy their artisanal London Dry Gin right at the brewery or sit down at the bar for a gin and tonic.

Cervecería Lowther is set in a three-story building and it also has a deck which is especially popular during the summer months.

Address: Mitre 1160, Bariloche | Los Calafates 281, Dina Huapi 

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cerveza Bachmann (@bachmanncerveza)

Bachmann

Bachmann beer was started by the Bachmann family who first arrived in Bariloche in 1907.

Beer-making started out as a hobby for Andrés Llanes and his wife Susana Bachmann, who worked to perfect their recipes out of the kitchen of their family home. 

It wasn't until 2007 that the duo opened their first brewpub, which was run by themselves and their children and the preparation was 100% visible. 

Four styles of beer were offered that are still produced today: Amber, Black Schwarzbier, Pilsen and Raspberry. 

They also began to prepare homemade foods of German origin such as Pretzel and Sauerkraut, and also typical local foods, such as trout and minced wild meats, which today are Bachmann's trademark.

You can enjoy Bachmann beer at their two pubs in Bariloche and you can also find their beers at bars across Argentina.

Bariloche is for chocolate lovers, and if you have a sweet tooth, you're going to want to check out some of the chocolate shops in this city.

The best place to do so is along Calle Mitre, also known as Bariloche's Avenue of Chocolate. There are so many chocolate shops clustered together that you can't walk more than a few steps without stumbling upon one!

Whenever we visit Bariloche, we like to make time to hit up at least one chocolatería. Not only are these good places to stock up on souvenirs - who doesn't like to receive artisanal chocolate as a gift? - but you can also enjoy pastries, ice cream and even hot chocolate.

In this guide, we're going to share some Bariloche chocolate shops you simply cannot miss. Plus, we'll tell you all about the Chocolate Museum and the annual Chocolate Festival. There's a reason Bariloche is the chocolate capital of Argentina!

1. Rapa Nui

The most famous chocolate shop in all of Bariloche is Rapa Nui. This is a large establishment in the city centre featuring a cafe, an ice cream parlour and an indoor skating rink! We like to visit at least once whenever we're in Bariloche.

The cafe has a beautiful Art Nouveau interior with colourful stained glass, lots of woodwork, and these beautiful pastry displays that are ever so enticing. It's a nice place to linger, do some people-watching and plan what to see and do in Bariloche.

The one chocolate we always order at Rapa Nui is the 'Franui’, a Patagonian raspberry bathed in a layer of white chocolate and another layer of milk chocolate. They sell these by the tubful; they are Rapa Nui's specialty and they are delicious!

We've also been known to frequent Rapa Nui's ice cream shop on a daily basis during the summer months. They have really good ice cream featuring lots of fun flavours like dulce de leche, tiramisú, and sambayón (made with egg yolks and sweet wine).

Address: Mitre 202, Bariloche

2. Mamuschka

Another well-loved chocolate establishment in Bariloche is Mamuschka. We have visited a few of their locations since they have shops all over Patagonia and Argentina.

Mamuschka was founded in 1989 and they produce 110 different types of chocolates. This place is hard to miss thanks to its bright red sign and matryoshkas - the Russian dolls that are stacked one inside the other.

The front of the shops is all about chocolate, and this is where you can build your own assorted box of chocolates.

They also have a café which I would highly recommend for a sweet breakfast or afternoon tea. Here you can sit down and sample some of their patisserie. We ordered a platter with raspberry alfajores, dulce de leche petit fours, mini apple tarts, lemon pie, pecan pie and more. 

Address: Mitre 298, Bariloche

3. Del Turista

Del Turista is an artisanal chocolate shop in Bariloche that has been around since 1964 and they have since expanded to multiple locations across Argentina.

This is a chocolate chain that we have encountered numerous times during our travels across Patagonia and it's always fun going in to build a box of chocolates.

However, they are more than just a chocolate shop; some of their locations also sell pastries, artisanal ice cream, and even local craft beer from Bariloche.

At Del Turista, you can get bonbons, chocolate bars and chocolate en rama which is a rolled chocolate with a branch-like design. You can also get some Argentine specialties like alfajores and conitos (dulce de leche cones bathed in chocolate).

4. Benroth

Benroth Chocolates was born in 1965 in the city of Bariloche. It was founded by Bernardo Benroth, who together with his family, has created one of the most prestigious chocolate brands in Patagonia.

The chocolate recipes at Benroth have been passed down from generation to generation, and to this day, the products are still made by its owners with all of the production done by hand and in plain sight.

Benroth offers a variety of chocolate flavours: bitter, semi-sweet, milk and white. 

And don't even get me started on the seemingly endless combinations of toppings and fillings: dulce de leche, almond, cereal, peanut, walnut, coconut, raisins, mint, strawberry, raspberry, Nutella, and so much more.

Aside from their main Bariloche location, you can also find them in Villa La Angostura and Buenos Aires.

5. Abuela Goye

The name Abuela Goye means 'Grandmother Goye' and the chocolate shop was named so by Luis Brogge in honour of his grandmother, Esther Cretton de Goye.

Grandma Goya arrived in Bariloche from Switzerland in the 19th century and settled in what would become the Swiss colony, today known as Colonia Suiza. The early settlers dedicated themselves to working the land, mainly growing wheat, oats, and cold-weather fruits, but they also began to produce sweet delicacies, including chocolates and pastries.

A few generations later, this gave rise to a chocolate shop, which has since expanded with locations in the Llao Llao Hotel along the Circuito Chico and Buenos Aires.

At Chocolatería Abuela Goye, you can expect to find chocolates, truffles, bars, bonbons, alfajores, ice cream and gourmet pastries.

6. Chocolaterie

Chocolaterie began in 2015 in Llao Llao and is the work of the VanWynsberghe family, whose ancestors arrived from Belgium with a passion for chocolate-making.

At Chocolaterie, they are well-known for their delicious hot chocolates, which are prepared using the traditional recipe from one of the oldest cocoa roasters and chocolate shops in Belgium.

You can choose the type of hot chocolate you want: Intenso topped with cacao powder, Patagonia with juniper, Clásico Belga with chocolate shavings, Picante with smoked paprika and freeze-dried raspberries, Americano with marshmallows, Perla Blanca with white chocolate, and Especiado with various spices and crunchy cereal dipped in chocolate. 

If you're visiting Bariloche in winter, you'll especially want to make time to visit Chocolaterie to warm up with a chocolatey drink.

Tip: Chocolaterie offers a chocolate-tasting experience that runs 40 minutes. You can book it directly on their website.

7. Frantom

Frantom opened its doors in 2002, and they've since become a well-respected name in Bariloche's chocolate scene.

Frantom doesn't have a huge variety of products, but that's because they pride themselves in being an extremely artisanal chocolate shop. For example, they have one person who makes nougat by hand all year round, and their premium line of painted chocolates is meticulously done by hand.

Their star products are their chocolate bars - semi-sweet, milk and white - with nuts and red fruits. Their chocolates en rama, millefeuille with dulce de leche and alfajores are also standout favourites.

Aside from selling chocolates, Frantom also has a cafe and pastry shop on site.

8. Delicias de la Patagonia

Delicias de la Patagonia opened in 2013 with the goal of creating delicious and healthy chocolate. 

Because food is medicine - even chocolate! - they use natural and organic ingredients from local producers. They do not use any type of preservatives, colourings or chemical flavourings.

Their product range includes bonbons with all sorts of fillings like coconut cream, chocolate mousse and limoncello. 

Meanwhile, they have an assortment of chocolate bars with nuts, raisins, cereal, peanuts, blueberries and forest berries.

And, we cannot forget their alfajores covered in dark chocolate or white chocolate and filled with either dulce de leche or berries.

9. Riche Patagonia

Riche Patagonia is a boutique chocolate shop in Bariloche with a second location in San Martín de los Andes. 

They have a huge variety of chocolate bars with almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts, walnuts, cereals, coconut, dulce de leche and more. 

Another item you'll find at Riche Patagonia is turrón, a nougat confection made with honey, sugar, egg white and toasted almonds. 

Their chocolate-covered fruits and nuts are sold in tins and are an especially popular gift. 

Plus, they also sell honey and fruit jams made using regional ingredients so you can gift your loved ones a taste of Patagonia.

10. Chocolates Torres

Chocolates Torres was founded in 2005 and it's another Bariloche chocolate shop quite well known for its artisanal chocolate. 

They sell an assortment of chocolate bars, bonbons, and some more elaborate hand-painted chocolates shaped like animals. 

Aside from chocolate, they also have a patisserie section where they sell cakes and pastries. Some of their most popular cakes are the Black Forest Cake and Torta Catedral, a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and Italian meringue that's named after a local mountain.

Address: Mitre 222, Bariloche

Bariloche Chocolate Museum

Aside from visiting some of the chocolate shops on this list, I would also recommend checking out Museo del Chocolate Havanna. 

Havanna is one of Argentina’s most beloved brands and best known for its alfajores. Their museum does a deep dive into the world of chocolate, covering its history from ancient Mesoamerican roots to its arrival in Europe, as well as its subsequent global spread.

The chocolate museum has some impressive sculptures of foxes, pumas and condors which are made entirely out of chocolate!

After visiting the museum, we exited through the Havanna cafe, so of course, we were tempted by a coffee and some sweet treats. I would say this is a good activity for a rainy or snowy day in Bariloche.

Bariloche Chocolate Festival

Since we're talking about all things chocolate, I also have to mention Bariloche's Fiesta del Chocolate. 

This annual chocolate festival takes place during Semana Santa or Easter Week, which is a big holiday in Argentina, so you'll want to book your stay in Bariloche well in advance.

Fiesta del Chocolate is a week-long event of chocolate tastings, hot chocolate, live performances and meet-and-greets with the Easter bunny.

During the festival, they even create the longest chocolate bar in the world along Mitre Street. The 218-metre chocolate bar is then available for tasting. 

It's a fun event for chocolate lovers and also families with kids. 

That being said, it's always a good time to visit Bariloche and you can enjoy the chocolaterías year-round.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,c1dd61fa44b148b9f87ea7d7d5e91786ebebe982

This 65-kilometre scenic loop literally translates to 'Short Circuit', and it's a route that winds through forests, lakes, and mountains in Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi. Along the way, you can stop at scenic lookout points, craft breweries, hiking trails, hidden beaches and more. It's one of the main attractions in Bariloche and well worth adding to your itinerary.

When my husband and I travelled the Circuito Chico, we hopped on the local bus and also walked some of the shorter segments, but you can just as easily explore by bike, tour, remis, or even by renting a car.

If you only have a couple of days in Bariloche and are pressed for time, you can see the highlights in half a day, and if you have a bit more time, you can linger along the circuit and turn it into a full-day activity.

In this guide, I’ll share how to experience Circuito Chico no matter your budget or travel style, highlight the best attractions, and give you practical tips so you can plan the perfect day tour from Bariloche.

5 Ways to Visit Circuito Chico, Bariloche

There are a few different ways to explore Bariloche's Circuito Chico, depending on how active and adventurous you are feeling. I'm going to outline all possible options so that you can choose what works best for you!

Car rental - This is the most flexible way to explore the circuit because you can stop at every viewpoint, relax at hidden beaches, and detour onto hiking trails. The downside is that not everyone feels comfortable driving in a foreign country and most cars in Argentina are manual. 

Public bus - This is a budget-friendly option, however, the buses get packed during high season and rush hour. Buses 20, 13 and 10 cover different parts of the Circuito Chico and some lines bypass certain stops, so have a look at the bus schedule here and plan accordingly. If you're taking the bus, I would suggest starting early and don't count on taking the last bus back into town in case it is full. 

Bike rental - For active travellers, cycling the Circuito Chico is a full-day adventure. Expect some steep hills, but if you go clockwise the climbs are more manageable. Rentals (with helmets and maps) are easy to find near Km 18 at the roundabout. You can even rent electric bikes to make the journey easier! The downside is that this isn't the most enticing option if there's bad weather. 

Taxi or remis - This is a very comfortable option if you want to see the highlights without driving yourself. You can hire a driver by the hour or agree on a flat rate for the loop. This option works best if you speak some Spanish and are able to negotiate a fair price with your driver. The trip usually takes 3–4 hours with photo stops.

Guided tour - The easiest, most hassle-free way to explore. Tours usually last half a day and come with commentary about history, culture, and the landscapes you’re seeing. It's a stress-free option, and great for first-time visitors or travellers short on time. The cons are that you're on a fixed schedule with less personal freedom.

TIP: Another popular scenic route in Patagonia is the drive from Villa La Angostura to San Martín de los Andes, locally known as Siete Lagos. The name translates to 'Seven Lakes' and it's a 107-kilometre drive through the lake district that can be done as a day trip, either by renting a car or joining a guided tour.

Attractions along Bariloche's Circuito Chico

Now let's cover what there is to see and do along the circuit. I did the Circuito Chico counterclockwise, so I've listed the attractions in that order. However, if you notice there's too much traffic in that direction, you can do the same loop clockwise.

Cerro Campanario Chair Lift

The first attraction as you approach Bariloche's Circuito Chico is Cerro Campanario. Located around kilometre 17.5 on Avenida Bustillo, this small forested hill offers one of the most breathtaking panoramic views in all of Patagonia. In fact, National Geographic once ranked this view among the ten best in the world! 

Getting to the top is half the fun. You can ride the chairlift, Aerosilla Cerro Campanario, for a bird’s-eye view of the sparkling Lago Nahuel Huapi below, or you can hike the steep but short trail (about 30–45 minutes) if you’re feeling energetic.

We decided to hike the trail, however, we'd take the chairlift if we had to do it over. There are far more beautiful day hikes in Bariloche, and we frankly found this one a bit dusty.

At the summit of Cerro Campanario, there's a viewing platform where you can appreciate the beauty of the Lake District including the mirror-like waters of Lago Moreno, the rugged peaks of Cerro López and Cerro Catedral, and the snow-capped ridges of the Andes stretching to the horizon. 

The cost to ride the chair lift is 25,000 (roughly $25 USD). You can check current rates here.

Parroquia San Eduardo

The nearby Capilla San Eduardo, a tiny wooden alpine-style chapel built in 1938, is one of the most photographed spots on the circuit thanks to its dramatic backdrop of mountains and lakes.

The small chapel overlooks Puerto Pañuelo, the departure point for lake excursions, and it also offers views of Llao Llao Hotel. It's worth the short climb up the stairs.

Hotel Llao Llao

This iconic hotel is a symbol of Bariloche and you're going to see it from a few different angles over the course of your day exploring Circuito Chico.

If you're planning a luxurious getaway to Bariloche, you'll want to stay at the Llao Llao Hotel. This is the most famous hotel in all of Argentina, and for good reason. The location is pristine!

If your budget doesn't stretch that far, you can always book afternoon tea in the Winter Garden (like we did!) or make a dinner reservation at one of their restaurants. That's one way to see the interior of the hotel and enjoy the grounds.

Puerto Pañuelo

Just downhill from the hotel, Puerto Pañuelo is the departure point for boat excursions on Lago Nahuel Huapi. From here, you can take day trips to Isla Victoria and Bosque de Arrayanes, both of which are part of Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi.

Even if you’re not hopping on a boat, the dock is worth a quick wander. The views across the lake to the distant snow-capped Andes are spectacular, and it’s a peaceful place to stretch your legs.

Boat trips run half-day and it's better to book in advance if you're visiting during high season (December to February).

Llao Llao Municipal Park

There are quite a few hiking options along Bariloche's Circuito Chico. Just past Puerto Pañuelo, you'll find Parque Municipal Llao Llao, which offers lots of short and easy trails.

Sendero Cerro Llao Llao - This 5.6-kilometre hike takes you to a lookout point atop Cerro Llao Llao. It offers the best panoramic views of Lake Moreno and Lake Nahuel Huapi, so it's a popular option. 

Sendero Villa Tacul - This 6-kilometre hike follows the same trail to Cerro Llao Llao, however, instead of taking the detour, you continue towards a pebbly, lakeside beach. 

Sendero Arrayanes - This is a 2.8-kilometre trail if you're planning to do it one-way (the trail starts and ends at two different points on the Circuito Chico), and it winds through an Arrayanes Forest, with the option of detouring to a couple of lakeside beaches.

I'm highlighting the main hikes, however, there are 16 different trails to choose from, and many of them can be combined. You can find a list of the hikes in Llao Llao Municipal Park here and plan accordingly.

Muelle Lago Escondido

Hidden just off the main road, this tiny wooden dock on Lago Escondido is one of the most peaceful spots on the Circuito Chico. 

The name translates to 'Hidden Lake' and it has a secluded feel, especially on calm mornings when the water mirrors the surrounding trees. There's a wooden boardwalk that leads down to the water.

Puente Arroyo La Angostura

This bridge spans the narrow channel that connects Bahía López with Lago Moreno, and it's one of those blink-and-you-miss-it gems on the Circuito Chico. 

The water here is incredibly clear, and you can often spot trout gliding beneath the surface from the bridge. 

This is also a great swimming spot during the summer months, when the pebbly shores and emerald waters look extra inviting. People bring their picnics and their mate to spend the day.

Canopy Bariloche

For a shot of adrenaline between scenic viewpoints, consider stopping at Canopy Bariloche, a zipline park set deep in the native forest near Bahía López. 

A series of steel cables let you soar through the treetops with panoramic glimpses of Lago Moreno and the surrounding peaks flashing by below your feet. 

It’s suitable for beginners and families, and guides handle all the safety equipment and instruction.

Allow about 1.5–2 hours for the full experience. Wear closed-toe shoes and bring cash for the entry fee. Book ahead if visiting during the summer in Bariloche when spots fill up quickly.

Colonia Suiza

A short detour off the main loop, Colonia Suiza is a little village settled by Swiss immigrants in the late 1800s. Here you’ll find cute wooden chalets, craft breweries, artisanal chocolate shops, and plenty of photo-worthy corners.

The village is best known for its Sunday artisan market and for its traditional curanto, a Patagonian dish cooked in a pit oven lined with hot stones and covered with leaves and earth. Sadly, we did not visit on a curanto day, so we enjoyed Swiss/German food instead!

Beyond the food, the town is a bit touristy and quirky, and it has access to a beautiful pebbly beach on the shores of Lago Moreno. 

TIP: Sundays and Wednesdays are best for a visit to Colonia Suiza if you want to try curanto.

Cervecería Patagonia

There are loads of craft breweries in Bariloche, however, the most famous of them all is Cervecería Patagonia. 

Perched on a hillside with sweeping views of Lago Moreno, Cervecería Patagonia is the perfect place to soak up the scenery over a cold pint. We were blown away by the views the first time we visited, and we like to swing by every time we're back in town.

The outdoor terrace is spectacular on sunny days, with long communal tables overlooking the lake and the forested peaks of Cerro López in the distance. 

You can sample their rotating lineup of IPAs, amber ales, and seasonal brews, or order a tasting flight to try a bit of everything. 

The onsite restaurant also serves Patagonian-inspired dishes, making it a great spot for a leisurely lunch before continuing your drive.

They also offer guided beer tours; there's a 1.5-hour tasting where you can sample four of their beers, and a 3-course meal option with beer pairings. Both of these beer tours can be booked here.

TIP: If Patagonia Brewery is too busy or you want something quieter, I would detour to Cervecería Gilbert, just a short walk over. This is one of our favourite breweries in Bariloche. It has a rustic, log cabin feel, and they serve hearty Patagonian food.

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Parque Nahuelito (@parque.nahuelito)

Parque Nahuelito

Tucked into the forest near km 24.5 of Avenida Bustillo, Parque Nahuelito is a quirky little dinosaur park that’s perfect if you’re travelling with kids. 

The outdoor trail winds through native Patagonian forest and features more than 30 life-sized dinosaur replicas, including some that move and roar! 

Plus, there's a fossil museum showcasing real prehistoric remains found in the region. 

Guided tours are included in the entry ticket and run every 20 minutes, explaining the history of dinosaurs in Patagonia and how fossils are discovered.

Circuito Chico Panoramic Point

There are loads of scenic stops along the Circuito Chico, but if you're looking for that classic postcard view, you'll want to stop at Punto Panorámico Circuito Chico. 

There’s a designated pullout with space for several cars, plus a large wooden platform where you can snap all your photos. 

From this point, you can see the blue arms of Lago Moreno curling below the forested Llao Llao Peninsula, with the jagged silhouette of Cerro López towering in the background.

It was quite busy when we stopped here, so we took turns taking photos for people and then having them taking photos for us. 

Playa Sin Viento

Another beach I like to recommend along Bariloche's Circuito Chico is Playa Sin Viento. The name says it all, this is the 'beach with no wind'. It's a small sheltered beach on the shores of Lago Moreno, and it is best known for its calm waters.

I'm not going to tell you it's always calm, because when the Patagonian winds blow, even the calmest of beaches will get choppy waters. However, on a good day, it's glassy like a mirror.

This beach is also a local favourite for swimming, stand-up paddleboarding, and kayaking. There are three different spots where you can rent kayaks and SUPs. Bring some cash with you for the rental.

Staying on the Circuito Chico, Bariloche

Whenever we visit Bariloche, we like to try staying in different places. So far, we've stayed on the Circuito Chico twice, and while it does require a bit of effort getting there (if you don't rent a car!), we do appreciate the quiet and relaxed feel it offers in comparison to the city centre. 

Posada Los Juncos - This boutique style guesthouse is set in a restored alpine house and it's right across from the lake. The staff are incredibly kind and attentive, and they serve home-cooked meals. This is where we stayed on our very first trip to Bariloche. 

Peninsula Petit Hotel - A cozy and secluded property with views of Lago Nahuel Huapi. The vibe is your home away from home.

Llao Llao Hotel - For a touch of luxury, you cannot go wrong with this iconic property. This is a resort, golf and spa property with multiple restaurants and a heated indoor-outdoor pool.

305727f2e2559139f7c80bfd67a745fd96e38704,che_argentina_travel,en,Bariloche's Isla Victoria & Arrayanes Forest: How to Visit on a Day Trip,"Today, we're going to share exactly how to visit Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest during your visit to San Carlos de Bariloche.

This popular day trip is done as part of a boat excursion and it visits two national parks: Nahuel Huapi National Park and Los Arrayanes National Park.

Isla Victoria, also known as Victoria Island, is the largest island in Nahuel Huapi Lake with beaches, hiking trails and some unique accommodations. Meanwhile, the Arrayanes Forest, which is visited in the second half of this boat tour, is home to a very unusual tree and a cabin that looks straight out of a fairy tale. These are two places you cannot miss in Patagonia!

Visiting Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest is something that can be arranged independently during your day trip to Circuito Chico, or booked as part of a guided tour, so we're going to guide you through both options so you can figure out which is right for you.

How to visit Isla Victoria

Getting to Puerto Pañuelo

After arriving in Bariloche, you'll want to make your way to Puerto Pañuelo, the port where all the boat tours depart from. It is located 25 kilometres outside of Bariloche, heading west on Avenida Exequiel Bustillo, the road that follows the lakeshore.

It's a 35-minute drive without traffic. That being said, there typically is a lot of traffic in Bariloche, especially during high season, so give yourself plenty of time to arrive.

Alternatively, you can take Bus #20 which departs from the Bariloche Bus Terminal and makes multiple stops along the way. It takes about an hour to reach Puerto Pañuelo by bus, though again, it could take much longer if there is traffic.

Puerto Pañuelo is located directly across from the famous Llao Llao Hotel, one of the most iconic hotels in Bariloche, so it's hard to miss.

You'll likely see lots of people getting off there either to do the boat tour or have afternoon tea at the hotel.

Visiting Isla Victoria with a guided tour

One of the advantages of visiting Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest as part of a guided tour is that you won't have to worry about organizing your own transportation to the port if you book the option that includes a transfer.

Book Lake Excursion to Isla Victoria & Arrayanes Forest

There are 4 ticket options when booking so be sure to scroll down and select your option carefully:

Catamaran Ticket

Catamaran Ticket with Transfers

Catamaran Ticket with Food

Catamaran Ticket with Food and Transfers

This tour includes:

Bilingual guide

Guided hike

Catamaran

Food and drinks (if option chosen)

Hotel transfers (if option chosen)

This tour does NOT include:

Entrance to the national park and the boat embarkation fee

Food and drinks (if this option is not chosen), but there is a bar on board

Isla Victoria and Arrayanes Forest Itinerary

The boat tour departs from Puerto Pañuelo and cruises along the cobalt waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake until it reaches Isla Victoria. The island forms part of Nahuel Huapi National Park which is Argentina's oldest national park.

Once you reach the island, you disembark at Puerto Anchorena where you have the option of going on a guided hike. However, if you prefer, you can explore the island independently so long as you are back at the dock on time for your departure.

Some points of interest on the islands include Playa del Toro, a beautiful beach with cool, turquoise waters. You can also do a short hike to Puerto Piedras Blancas, another port with a beach on the east coast of the island.

You then board the boat once more and cruise to the Arrayanes Forest, which sits on the Quetrihué Peninsula that juts out from the town of Villa La Angostura and is located within Los Arrayanes National Park.

Tip: You can also visit the Arrayanes Forest from Villa La Angostura and it's a much shorter distance. So that's another option to consider if it works better with your travel itinerary. 

Once you reach this next stop, you disembark and join another guided walk along the boardwalk loop that runs through the Arrayanes Forest. Alternatively, you can explore at your own leisure.

The Arrayanes Forest is famous for its flakey cinnamon-coloured trees; the unique thing about them is that they always feel cool to the touch because their bark is so thin.

Most of the trees in this forest are about 300 years old, though there are a few rare specimens over 650 years of age! The forest is also said to have inspired Walt Disney's film Bambi.

There's a famous log cabin tea house in the forest, where you can enjoy a sandwich, slice of cake or cup of tea.

Tip: If you're hungry, head straight to the tea house as soon as you disembark or you may not have enough time for food before it's time to board again. 

Visiting Isla Victoria independently

Booking your ticket to Isla Victoria

Visiting Isla Victoria independently requires a tiny bit more work, but it is certainly possible to do so even if you don't have a strong command of Spanish.

Cau Cau is the boat tour operator that takes you to Isla Victoria.

You can book the tickets directly on their website (the language options are English, Spanish and Portuguese), or you can do so in person once you arrive at the port.

They offer morning and afternoon departures. Their schedule and rates are listed here.

I would personally recommend booking your tickets online in advance, especially if you're travelling to Bariloche during high season. If you cannot do so, try to arrive at the port early to buy your ticket in person.

Tip: Aside from buying the ticket for the boat tour, you also need to pay an embarkation fee and admission fee to Nahuel Huapi National Park. There will be booths to do so at Puerto Pañuelo. 

﻿

Things to know before visiting Isla Victoria

What should I wear when visiting Isla Victoria?

When visiting Isla Victoria, it's best to wear comfortable running shoes since you will be walking around the island.

It's also a good idea to dress in layers as the weather in Patagonia can change quickly - a waterproof rain jacket is always a good idea.

In the summertime, you can pack a bathing suit and towel if you'd like to enjoy a dip in the water instead of going on the guided hike.

In the wintertime, it's a good idea to have a warm hat, scarf and gloves as it can get windy.

Here's what to expect from each season in Bariloche.

What is the weather like on Isla Victoria?

In the summer, daytime averages on Bariloche's Isla Victoria are 19-24°C / 66-75°F, and in winter the averages are 3-8°C / 37-46°F  degrees.

Does the excursion get cancelled if there's bad weather?

No, this is an excursion that runs year-round whether there's snow, rain, wind or sunshine.

Is Isla Victoria worth a visit?

If Bariloche is the only place you're visiting in Patagonia and you want to get a taste of nature - lakes, forests and mountains! - then this boat tour excursion offers that in the form of a light adventure day. I even recommend doing this tour if you only have 2 days in Bariloche!

The boat tour to Puerto Blest is another alternative if you're looking to venture a bit further and visit a less-touristed corner of Lago Nahuel Huapi. You can even opt to stay overnight at Hotel Puerto Blest.

If you're sticking around a bit longer and visiting El Bolson, you may also enjoy the boat tour of Lago Puelo, which also features epic mountain landscapes, some hiking, and takes you as far as the border with Chile.

Looking for something different? You can get a better idea of some of the best Bariloche day tours available here. 

Staying overnight on Isla Victoria

It is possible to stay overnight on Isla Victoria, though options are limited and more high-end.

Hostería Isla Victoria Lodge

Hostería Isla Victoria is a lodge set atop a cliff and its vantage point is unparalleled offering panoramic views of  Bahía Anchorena, the turquoise waters of Playa del Toro, and forested mountains as far as the eye can see.

The lodge dates back to 1937 and it's a boutique property offering a swimming pool, spa, library, wine cellar, and fine dining at their on-site restaurant. Basically, once you arrive, you have everything you need.

There are also opportunities to enjoy a myriad of outdoor activities like hiking, biking, kayaking, and horseback riding accompanied by local guides.

The beauty of staying overnight at Isla Victoria is that you'll have the island to yourself after the day visitors depart back to Bariloche, so it's a very different experience from what you get when you come for the day.

Book your stay at Hostería Isla Victoria Lodge.

Folk Camp Piedras Blancas

Folk Camp offers bespoke glamping on Isla Victoria and seeks to combine the magic of 'being in the middle of nowhere' with comfort and style.

The accommodations consist of domes that are set along the beach offering views of Bahía Piedras Blancas on the eastern side of the island.

They offer double and triple domes to accommodate different group sizes.

This glamping experience is organized via Wilderness Patagonia, a travel company that focuses on responsible tourism and conservation in the Patagonian region.

You can find a list of even more unique glamping domes across Patagonia here.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,b1cea3acf23fce38390f8a12d4bd2eab2059d67b

A Beagle Channel cruise is one of the top activities to enjoy when visiting Ushuaia. You've reached the 'End of the Earth' and now you finally get to cruise one of the southernmost waterways in the world. But which tour should you choose and what's the difference between them anyway?

On my first visit to Ushuaia, I walked into a tour operator's office and booked the first Beagle Channel cruise I saw without asking too many questions. It wasn't until we reached the shores of Martillo Island and I saw a small group of visitors walking among the penguins while we looked on that I realized not all tours are created equal. 

When it comes to Beagle channel cruises you can choose between larger vessels or smaller vessels that provide a more personal experience. You have large group tours versus small boat hires that feel more intimate and you can enjoy with your group of family and friends. Most importantly, you have boat tours that are allowed to disembark on Martillo Island to visit the penguin colony and others that are only permitted to view them from the shores. 

Even though I didn't get to walk with penguins, cruising the Beagle Channel turned out to be one of the highlights of my visit to Ushuaia! I got to see the famous red and white Les Éclaireurs Lighthouse - sometimes mistaken for the Lighthouse at the End of the World! 

Plus, I saw sea lions sunbathing on a rocky outcrop, thousands of cormorants swirling over an island, and epic mountain views in every direction.

So let's navigate all these Beagle Channel cruises and help find the right one for you!

2. Beagle Channel Tour to Martillo Island and Walk Among Penguins

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH:  6.5 hours 

This is the priciest and most exclusive Beagle Channel tour out there, so admittedly it won't be everyone's cup of tea. 

However, what makes this cruise special is the opportunity to walk among penguins - an activity that is very controlled and only a limited number of people get to do. 

This tour is also a bit different in the sense that you don't embark at the harbour in Ushuaia, but rather, you travel one hour by minibus accompanied by your guide to Estancia Haberton. This is a famous estancia in the city outskirts that was founded in 1884 by Augusto Lasserre as Fort Ushuaia on the settlement of the former mission of Thomas Bridges.

Estancia Haberton is a popular day trip from Ushuaia, so technically with this tour you are getting two activities in one!

Upon arriving at the estancia, you will get a guided tour of the place before boarding a semi-rigid boat (ZODIAK) and cruising 15 minutes over to Martillo Island. Along the way, you will also see Les Éclaireurs Lighthouse, Isla de Los Pájaros, Isla de Los Lobos and all manner of seabirds and sea lions. 

On the island, you will spend 1 hour walking among Magellanic penguins and Gentoo penguins (the latter are a bit rare), always accompanied by your guide. This walk with the penguins is what sets this Beagle Channel cruise apart from the rest, as most tour operators are only allowed to approach the shores and see the penguins from the boat without disembarking. 

Whether this experience is worth the price tag is up to you to decide!

You will then return to the estancia for lunch (the cost of the meal is not included in the tour price), and lastly, you'll visit the Acatushun Museum of rare marine mammals.

PROS:

Includes a 1-hour walk with Magellanic and Gentoo penguins

Visits the historic Estancia Haberton 

Friendly and knowledgeable guides every step of the way

CONS: 

It is a 1-hour bus journey to reach the estancia

3. Beagle Channel Navigation to the Pingüinera

⭐️ RATING: 4/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 6 hours

This is the most popular Beagle Channel cruise and it's a group catamaran excursion. This tour runs daily during high season so it's a well-oiled machine and everything flows really well. 

After leaving the pier, the catamaran enters the Beagle Channel and you get great panoramic views of downtown Ushuaia framed by Mount Olivia in the background. 

You first reach Isla de Los Lobos, where you have the chance to view sea lions in their natural habitat from the boat. Next up is Isla de Los Pájaros, which is home to countless cormorants, both Magellanic and Imperial. 

The boat tour then brings you to Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse situated on an archipelago by the same name. On these islets, it is possible to see the remains of Monte Cervantes, a ship that was shipwrecked in 1930. 

During the cruise, you'll also be able to see Gable Island and the Puerto Williams Naval Base (located in Navarino Island, Chile). 

Upon arriving at Isla Martillo, the catamaran approaches the beach carefully. Though no one is permitted to disembark during this tour, you do get to see the colony of Magellanic Penguins that nest during the summer months. 

The penguins are very curious so they'll approach the boat, waddle down the beach, and even swim around the catamaran. It's a great opportunity to take photos and enjoy the penguins from a distance. 

This was the tour that we booked during our trip to Ushuaia. The price was mid-range (this isn't the most expensive tour or the cheapest!), and even though we didn't get to do an island trek or walk with penguins, we did get to see the main sights along the Beagle Channel, meaning the lighthouse and lots of wildlife. I'd say we saw way more wildlife than we were even expecting!

PROS:

Larger vessel means it's a smoother ride on choppy waters

Visit all the main attractions on the Beagle Channel

You get a Beagle Channel passport stamp (if you'd like one)

CONS:

Large group tour means it's a less personalized experience

Can get a bit crowded out on the deck

Does not disembark on Martillo Island to walk with penguins

ADDITIONAL INFO:

Duration: 6 hours

Language: English and Spanish

Operated by: Piratour

Meeting point: Muelle Turistico

Not wheelchair accessible

""Absolutely fantastic and memorable experience. We had a beautiful day on the water and the penguins were amazing. We deliberately booked a trip that does not allow you off the boat because we did not want to disturb the penguins’ habitat. We were able to get plenty of clear and enjoyable viewing opportunities from the boat. This is a memory that will last a lifetime! We had some serious weather on the way back (which is to be expected) and the crew did an excellent job navigating it. We definitely recommend this journey!"" -Lisa N

FAQs About Beagle Channel

Where is the Beagle Channel? The Beagle Channel is a navigable channel in the extreme southern part of South America. It is located at the southern tip of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, which is shared by Argentina and Chile. Specifically, the Beagle Channel runs between several islands of the archipelago, forming a natural border between the two countries. Is the Beagle Channel rough? Because the Beagle Channel is situated in the extreme southern part of South America, it can experience varying conditions and its waters can indeed be rough at times. However, compared to other waterways in the region, such as the Drake Passage, the Beagle Channel is often considered relatively sheltered and calm. Why is the Beagle Channel important? The Beagle Channel serves as a navigational route for ships travelling between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, especially those avoiding the rougher waters of the Drake Passage or Cape Horn. The channel is a key passage for vessels heading to and from Antarctica, making it crucial for scientific and tourist expeditions to the continent. What animals can you see in the Beagle Channel? Some of the animals you can expect to see while cruising the Beagle Channel include sea lions, seals, dolphins and whales. Magellanic penguins are the most common type of penguin around these parts, and you can also spot seabirds like albatrosses, petrels and cormorants. 

Which Beagle Channel Cruise is right for you? 

As you can see, there are lots of different options when it comes to booking a Beagle Channel Cruise in Ushuaia, Argentina. 

You can opt for a small vessel or a large vessel, a tour that lets you walk with penguins or a tour where you can view them from the boat, or a tour that visits an estancia or just does a classic boat trip. 

The right Beagle Channel boat tour will vary from one traveller to the next, but hopefully, you now have a better idea of what to look for and what to expect.

2644eb516253e77982976cefef324fa35c92d084,che_argentina_travel,en,Best Things to Do in El Calafate | Patagonia's Land of Glaciers,"Here are the best things to do in El Calafate, because no trip to Patagonia would be complete without a few days in the Land of Glaciers.

El Calafate is a picturesque town located in Argentine Patagonia that sits on the southern shore of Lago Argentino and serves as a gateway to Los Glaciares National Park. 

Most visitors to El Calafate have one goal in mind and that is to see the world-renowned Perito Moreno Glacier, which is one of the few advancing glaciers in the world and one of the gems of South America! Plus, there are so many different ways to admire the beauty of the glaciers: you can do an ice trek, take a boat tour, or view them from the balconies and boardwalks.

Aside from glaciers, El Calafate is also the perfect playground for outdoor activities on the Patagonian steppe. You can join a 4x4 off-road adventure, visit caves with ancient paintings, kayak the milky waters of La Leona River, spend the day learning about the gaucho way of life at an estancia, go on a horseback riding excursion and so much more!

El Calafate proved to be one of the highlights of our trip across southern Patagonia. We quickly fell in love with the magnificence of the ice fields, the pristine blue hues of the glaciers and the bobbing icebergs. 

We dedicated two full days to exploring Los Glaciares National Park; first seeing all the glaciers up close on a full-day boat trip and then exploring the boardwalks on foot and visiting the Iceberg Lagoon. The rest of our week was spent exploring the town as well as going on various day tours from El Calafate.

This is our list of the best things to do in El Calafate, Argentina so you can get inspired for your trip!

How to get to El Calafate

Reaching El Calafate is an exciting journey filled with stunning landscapes. Most travellers arrive by air, flying into Comandante Armando Tola International Airport (FTE), which is approximately 21 kilometres from the town centre.

The airport is well-connected with domestic flights from major cities in Argentina, including Buenos Aires.

Another option is to travel by bus, enjoying the scenic road trip through Patagonia. Bus services connect El Calafate with various destinations across Patagonia, providing a more budget-friendly and scenic travel experience. 

Things to do in El Calafate, Argentina 

1. Visit Los Glaciares National Park

El Calafate is the gateway to the Land of Glaciers, so of course, a visit to Los Glaciares needs to be at the top of the list!

Los Glaciares National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its spectacular glacial landscapes, towering mountains, and pristine wilderness. It covers an area of over 7,200 square miles, making it the largest national park in Argentina, and it's a haven for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts. 

The park has two different access points. Nearby El Chaltén, gives you access to the northern part of the park which is considered Argentina's trekking capital with its epic mountain peaks. Meanwhile, El Calafate gives you access to the southern part of the park where you can witness some of the most beautiful glaciers in the world!

In this part of the park, you can walk the Perito Moreno Glacier Walkways, locally known as Pasarelas, where you can see the Perito Moreno Glacier and watch it calve into the lake. 

This was hands down one of the most magical moments we experienced in the park. There's something special about witnessing the immensity of the glacier and the ice field it descends from, feeling the crispness of the icy air in your face, and seeing the glacial blue hues of the ice, that just makes you feel so small and yet so alive!

We spent the whole day walking the different walkways and stopping at the different observation points along the way to take in the show. This is our guide to visiting Perito Moreno Glacier independently. 

We also enjoyed visiting Laguna de los Témpanos, or the Iceberg Lagoon. This is where the chunks of ice that break off the Perito Moreno Glacier end up. It's a pretty cool spot and worth the little detour. 

There are different boardwalks and trails to enjoy in the Pasarelas section of Los Glaciares National Park. These include:

Central Circuit - 600 metres - 1:00 hs - Easy

Lower Circuit - 1100 metres - 1:15 hs - Challenging

Forest Trail - 570 metres - 0:45 hs - Moderate

Shoreline Trail - 1117 metres - 1:30 hs - Moderate

Accessible Circuit - 565 metres - 0:30 hs - Very easy

2. See the Glaciers on a Boat Tour 

If I could only recommend one activity to every traveller visiting El Calafate, it would be to do a boat tour on Lago Argentino to visit the glaciers up close and personal.

Technically, you can do a short 1-hour tour from Los Glaciares National Park, however, I would recommend the full-day tour aboard Maria Turquesa to visit all the glaciers up close. This activity is definitely a splurge and we debated booking it, but it turned out to be our favourite tour of the whole trip and I can tell you that tears were shed by almost every passenger when we reached the final glacier of the day.

The tour we did is called Glaciers Gourmet. We opted for the basic option which includes a packed gourmet lunch box, however, you can also choose the premium tasting menu which gives you access to a private deck. 

We were picked up from our accommodations in El Calafate and driven to a private port where we boarded the ship. 

Over the course of the day, we cruised the icy teal waters of Lake Argentino which is the largest freshwater lake in Argentina.

We saw the Seco Glacier, Heim Glacier, Spegazzini Glacier, Upsala Glacier, and Bertacchi Glacier, finally reaching the iconic Perito Moreno Glacier. That's a lot of glaciers in one day!

And when we weren't ooh-ing and ahh-ing at the glaciers, we were mesmerized by the icebergs floating by, the glacial waterfalls running down the mountain, and spotting eagles flying overhead. 

We fished chunks of glacier from the lake - some people had them with whiskey! - and we even disembarked at one point and went on a guided hike at Puesto de Las Vacas. 

All this to say, we loved our glacier boat cruise through Lago Argentino and we're still raving about it years later! Here's a list of the best Perito Moreno Glacier tours for some travel inspiration.

This is the Glaciers Gourmet boat tour aboard Maria Turquesa that we went on. It's a full-day tour lasting 10-12 hours and you get to see all the glaciers up close and personal!

3. Explore Perito Moreno Glacier on an Ice Trek

Perito Moreno Glacier is one of the most iconic and impressive natural wonders in Los Glaciares National Park.

The glacier covers an area of about 250 square kilometres and is part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third-largest reserve of fresh water on the planet!

It's renowned for its sheer size and beauty, however, what sets Perito Moreno Glacier apart from the rest is its active nature; it is one of the few glaciers in the world that is still advancing. 

The glacier's terminus reaches Lago Argentino, and as it moves forward, it periodically creates a natural dam, separating the waters of the Brazo Rico from the rest of the lake. 

Eventually, the pressure from the dammed water causes a spectacular rupture known as a calving event, creating a thunderous roar as giant ice chunks fall into the lake. This is a major event that takes place every 4 to 5 years. 

We've already talked about viewing Perito Moreno Glacier from the boardwalk and seeing it on a boat tour, but now let's talk about a more active option: ice trekking!

To do the glacier trek, you first need to reach the glacier and that involves boarding a vessel at Bajo de las Sombras and crossing over the Rico Arm. Once you reach the other side, you get geared up with crampons and ice axes, and you embark on your ice trek with your trusty guide. 

The glacier trek is a unique way to explore the glacier and its blue-hued crevasses and seracs. So if you're looking for a bit of adventure, this activity certainly ticks the boxes!

Glacier treks are an expensive tour item and you can probably get them for a bit cheaper if you book locally once you arrive. But if you can, try to reserve a few days in advance as spots fill up fast and there is only one operator for this activity and that's Hielo y Aventura.

This Perito Moreno Glacier trek includes transportation to and from the park, a professional guide, all ice trekking equipment and has a maximum of 10 people per guide.

4. Go Bird Watching at Laguna Nimez

Another activity to add to your list of things to do in El Calafate is bird watching at Laguna Nimez Reserve.

Laguna Nimez is a reserve situated on the shores of Lake Argentino and it offers a mix of wetlands, lagoons, and grasslands. This makes it a haven for a wide variety of birdlife and an ideal location for bird-watching enthusiasts.

The lagoon is home to 132 different bird species, both migratory and resident. Some of the notable species include flamingos, black-necked swans, coscoroba swans, upland geese, kelp gulls, and numerous waterfowl. The reserve's diverse ecosystems provide habitat for both aquatic and terrestrial birds.

We were looking for some light activities to enjoy around town after some action-packed days, so we were quite pleased to learn about the reserve. The trails are easy to follow and there are also strategic observation points and bird-watching huts along the way for some optimal bird-watching. 

One of the highlights of the reserve is the presence of a flamingo colony. They gather in the shallow waters of the lagoons and their distinctive pink plumage makes them quite the attraction. We were certainly excited to spot them!

The whole walk is 3 kilometres and takes about 1.5 hours to complete. 

5. Visit the Glaciarium Patagonian Ice Museum

The Glaciarium Patagonian Ice Museum is an interpretive center dedicated to showcasing the unique environment and glaciers of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. 

The Glaciarium is situated about 6 kilometres west of El Calafate and it also offers free transportation there and back making it easily accessible from the town. The shuttle usually runs daily at 12:00 and 18:00, however, you'll want to confirm this on their website in case the schedule changes. 

Once you arrive at Glaciarium, you can expect to find a range of exhibits and displays that explore the science, history, and impact of glaciers in Patagonia. There are interactive installations, multimedia presentations, and educational panels provide insights into the formation, movement, and importance of glaciers.

One of the highlights of the Glaciarium is the Perito Moreno Glacier Room. This space is dedicated to one of the most famous glaciers in the world, allowing visitors to learn about its characteristics, significance, and the environmental changes affecting it.

The museum offers a unique 3D experience that allows visitors to virtually explore the glaciers, understand ice formations, and realize the scale and majesty of the glaciers in the region.

Glaciarium also has its very own ice bar located underground, where you can enjoy a drink in a glass of ice at sub-zero temperatures. Inside the bar, there are ice sculptures and coloured lights, making it a fun photo op. Even we were lured in and we're Canadian - we get enough ice and snow as it is!

6. Visit the Historical Interpretation Center

The Historical Interpretation Center of El Calafate, locally known as the Centro de Interpretación Histórica, is a museum dedicated to showcasing the history and natural heritage of the Patagonian region. 

We like to include a few museum visits wherever we travel because they're usually a nice rainy day activity or a good option for when you're craving a low-key day. 

We didn't know what to expect when we came across this museum, so imagine our surprise when we came face to face with mega mammals and dinosaur skeletons unique to Patagonia! We got to see animals that we didn't even know had walked this Earth and that lived not that long ago. 

The one that particularly caught my attention was the Megatherium, a now-extinct giant sloth that would have stood 5 to 6 metres tall. 

What is perhaps most surprising is that the Megatherium roamed Patagonia with humans. They existed up until 8,500 years ago when they were hunted into extinction. 

These were creatures that hadn't known a lot of predators, they were slow-moving, and they had a long gestational period - basically a lot of factors that made them an easy target for humans. 

The Historical Interpretation Center is small, but we found it fascinating, so if you're looking for underrated things to do in El Calafate, maybe add this museum to your list!

7. Spend the Day at an Estancia

If you're looking for a fun day trip from El Calafate, you can't go wrong with a visit to an estancia.

An estancia is a working ranch, typically used for rearing sheep and cattle, and you'll find these scattered across Patagonia as well as other parts of Argentina.

Estancia Nibepo Aike is perhaps one of the best-known ranches near El Calafate located a 1.5-hour drive from the town. 

The estancia came to be before the formation of the national park, so it sits within the boundaries of Los Glaciares National Park overlooking the southern arm of Lago Argentino. The setting is nothing short of majestic!

We visited Estancia Nibepo Aike on a day trip and had a really fun time. We got to watch a sheep-shearing demonstration, learn about the gaucho way of life, hike around the estancia grounds, and enjoy a feast of a BBQ with wine.

It honestly made us wish we had booked to stay overnight - there are lots of estancias in El Calafate! 

A couple of nights in a setting like this would be a great way to end the trip to El Calafate.

This day trip to Estancia Nibepo Aike can be booked as a half-day or full-day excursion. The full-day option includes horseback riding in Los Glaciares National Park with a guide. 

8. Tour Punta Walichu Archaeological Site

Punta Walichu is an important archaeological site located near El Calafate. Here you'll find a number of caves at the foot of a cliff on the shore of Lake Argentino and inside those caves are ancient rock paintings!

These artworks are believed to be over 4,000 years old and provide an insight into the early human settlements in this region of Patagonia. 

The first inhabitants of these lands came during the Glacial Age and are believed to have been the predecessors of the Tehuelches. The cave paintings depict painted hands, the animals that lived in the area as well as the inhabitants' hunting methods.

Punta Walichu, sometimes also called Cuevas Gualicho, is also of geological importance as the caves and rock formations were shaped by glacial and post-glacial processes.

If you're planning to rent a car during your visit, you can reach the caves by driving along Route 11 heading east out of town. About 6 kilometres into your drive you'll notice a small unmarked gravel road with a sign that reads Punta Walichu. Here you'll turn left and drive an additional 3 kilometres to the shores of Lago Argentino. 

Alternatively, you can join a tour that includes transportation and a guided visit to the caves. 

This Lake and Caverns 4x4 Tour takes you to Punta Bonita for panoramic views, and Punta Walichu to visit the caves. It also includes lunch or dinner overlooking Lago Argentino. 

9. Take a 4x4 Off-Road Adventure

Another activity you can enjoy in El Calafate is a 4x4 off-road adventure to explore the rugged and pristine landscapes of the Patagonian region. 

Patagonia is known for its stunning lakes and towering mountain ranges. A 4x4 adventure allows you to reach elevated vantage points that offer panoramic views of the surrounding scenery, including the turquoise waters of Lago Argentino and the majestic peaks of the Andes. Some tours go up to Cerro Frias while others go to Cerro Huyliche.

The off-road routes often lead through areas with unique flora and fauna, so you have a good chance of observing the local wildlife, including guanacos, foxes, and various bird species. 

This 4x4 excursion takes you to the Balconies of Calafate for views of Lago Argentino, fossil spotting and if you're lucky an encounter with condors flying overhead. 

10. Join a Horseback Riding Excursion

If you're looking for some active things to do in El Calafate, you may want to consider a horseback riding excursion. This is a great way to soak in the Patagonian landscapes which feature arid steppe, snow-capped mountains and milky turquoise lakes.

Since most horseback riding experiences in El Calafate take place at estancias, this also means you get a glimpse of rural life and gaucho culture. And because this is Argentina, the outing typically ends with a traditional BBQ or asado. 

Horseback riding trails vary in difficulty and duration, catering to riders of different skill levels. Your guide will ask about your horse riding experience and assign you a horse accordingly.

This horseback riding excursion at Estancia Rio Mitre includes epic mountain views, a ride to the shores of Lago Argentino, and an Argentine BBQ to end the day. 

11. Go Kayaking on La Leona River

Kayaking La Leona River is another fun day excursion you can plan from El Calafate. This activity takes place in La Leona which is an outpost in the middle of the Patagonian steppe, halfway between the town of El Calafate and El Chaltén. 

La Leona River connects Lago Argentino to Lago Viedma and it has beautiful milky blue waters. 

Kayaking around these parts means you'll be provided with a wetsuit and have a professional guide with you. 

This particular tour is also combined with a hike to La Leona Petrified Forest where you can find dinosaur fossils and see ancient petrified tree trunks dating back millions of years when the climate in this part of the world was very different.

This full-day kayaking tour on La Leona River also includes a guided hike through a petrified forest in search of dinosaur bones. This tour has a maximum of 8 participants.

12. Take a Helicopter Tour over the Glaciers

If you're looking for a bucket list activity in Patagonia, you'll want to add a flight over the glaciers to your list!

A helicopter tour offers a unique perspective of the stunning landscapes of Patagonia where you can soak in the magic of the ice field, glaciers, lakes, mountains, and the vast Patagonian wilderness.

This is not a budget-friendly activity, let me warn you, so it won't be for everyone. However, if Patagonia is a once-in-a-lifetime destination for you and you came here ready to see and do it all, then by all means!

DAP Airline has scenic helicopter flights to Perito Moreno Glacier and to Mount Fitz Roy. You can view their rates here - these rates are for a 15-minute flight, 4 passengers and full use of the aircraft. 

14. Wander Around El Calafate Town

El Calafate is a really cute town with lots of wooden cabin-style constructions that give the place a bit of a frontier feel.

The main street, Avenida del Libertador, is lined with shops, cafes, and restaurants. It's a nice place for a stroll, and if you have the time, it's worth spending a couple of hours browsing the shops and buying some souvenirs of Argentina.

Aldea de los Gnomos is a little pedestrian street that is lined with little boutiques where you can pick up handicrafts, woven textiles and leather goods.

You'll also find several ice cream shops along the main avenue, so if you're looking to treat yourself to a scoop of artisanal ice cream, try some of the local flavours: calafate berries if you'd like to return to Patagonia one day (that's what legend says) or dulce de leche which is a classic.

14. Sip some Patagonian craft beer

Argentina is a wine-drinking country, but Patagonia loves its craft beer!

Never have I seen so many craft breweries so close together, and I'm not just talking about El Calafate, this is something you encounter in most Patagonian mountain towns. 

A few to check out include La Zorra Taproom, Cervecería Artesanal Chopen and La Fábrica Cervecería. Or just walk down the main street and choose whichever appeals to you the most - you'll notice many of these breweries have outdoor patios. 

Order a flight of beers if you fancy doing a tasting and some good pub grub to go along with it. 

15. Sample the Local Patagonian Cuisine

Last but not least, how about sampling some of the local Patagonian cuisine, because you're probably going to be hungry after all the things to do in El Calafate we've listed above. Some traditional dishes to look out for include:

Patagonian Lamb: Known for its high-quality meat, Patagonia is a haven for lamb lovers. Grilled or slow-cooked, Patagonian lamb is often seasoned with local herbs and spices, resulting in a tender and flavourful dish.

Trucha: With numerous lakes and rivers, trout is a common and delicious local specialty. Grilled or baked, Patagonian trout is often served with simple yet flavorful accompaniments, allowing the natural taste of the fish to shine.

Calafate Berries: The calafate berry, native to the region, is celebrated in various culinary creations. Look for calafate berry jams, desserts, and sauces, as these berries add a unique and distinctive flavour to local dishes.

Empanadas: Empanadas are a beloved staple in Argentine cuisine, and El Calafate is no exception. These pastry pockets are typically filled with minced meat, cheese, or vegetables, offering a tasty snack or light meal.

Cazuela: Cazuela is a traditional stew made with meat, vegetables, and spices. It's a warming and hearty dish that is especially comforting during the cooler months.

Dulce de Leche Treats: Argentina's famous dulce de leche is often featured in desserts in El Calafate. Try dulce de leche-filled pastries, cakes, or ice cream for a sweet and indulgent treat.

You can get barbecued lamb, braised ossobuco, and even try guanaco stew if you're looking for something very local.

Isabel Cocina al Disco

Isabel specializes in comida al disco, meaning food cooked on a plow disk - yes, we are referring to farming equipment! This is a traditional way of cooking that was quite popular in the estancias and anywhere rural. You can get lamb, pork, trout, chicken and beef. Plus you have different sauces to choose from for your base.

La Cocina

La Cocina is a fun restaurant for a pasta tasting - ñoqui, ravioli, spaghetti, you name it! They have three different pasta sets to choose from and each one comes with three different pastas with various sauces. It was really fun to get a taste of everything and it was a cozy setting that made it feel like you were sitting in you grandma's kitchen.

When's the Best Time to Visit El Calafate?

The best time to visit El Calafate ultimately depends on the type of experience you are hoping to have, as the weather and activities vary throughout the year. El Calafate experiences distinct seasons, each offering unique attractions:

Spring (September to November)

Spring marks the beginning of the tourist season in El Calafate. The weather starts to warm up, with daytime temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C (45 to 59°F). Spring is an excellent time for nature enthusiasts as flowers begin to bloom, and wildlife becomes more active. It's also a quieter time before the peak summer season.

Summer (December to February)

Summer is the high tourist season, and temperatures range from 10 to 23°C (50 to 73°F). Days are long, with extended daylight hours. This is the best time for outdoor activities, including glacier tours, hiking, and boat trips on Lake Argentino. The warm weather allows for a comfortable exploration of the region's natural beauty.

Fall (March to May)

Fall sees a decrease in temperatures, ranging from 5 to 15°C (41 to 59°F). It's a transitional season with fewer tourists. Fall offers stunning landscapes as the leaves change colour, creating picturesque scenes. It's also a good time for hiking and enjoying the tranquillity of the region.

Winter (June to August)

Winter is the low season, and temperatures can drop below freezing, ranging from -2 to 7°C (28 to 45°F). Snowfall is very much a possibility. While some outdoor activities may be limited due to the cold, winter in El Calafate offers a unique charm. It's an ideal time for those interested in snow-covered landscapes and a quieter experience.

As you can see, the choice of the best time to visit El Calafate depends on personal preferences and the type of activities you wish to pursue. 

If you're interested in exploring glaciers and making the most of all the outdoor activities and excursions, then the summer months (December to February) will give you the most options. 

However, if you prefer a quieter experience and don't mind cooler temperatures, spring and fall can offer beautiful landscapes and fewer crowds.

Is El Calafate worth visiting?

Yes, El Calafate is absolutely worth visiting! 

If you want to see the Perito Moreno Glacier and visit Los Glaciares National Park, El Calafate is the gateway town to these experiences and so many others. 

Whether you have 2 days in El Calafate and can only cover the highlights, or a full week to go on all the day trips, this destination is one worth adding to your Patagonia itinerary. 

I would recommend combining your trip to El Calafate with a visit to El Chaltén. These towns are best visited in tandem. This article covers the best things to do in El Chalten featuring plenty of hiking and other outdoor activities. 

If your travel plans allow for it, you can even book a flight from El Calafate to Ushuaia and also explore the southernmost city in the world.

Best Tierra del Fuego National Park Tours

1. Tierra del Fuego National Park Trekking and Canoeing

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 8 hours | ✅ Book it!

This Tierra del Fuego National Park tour allows you to experience the park by land and by water. It's a great option for travellers who are looking for an active tour of the national park. 

First things first, this tour includes transportation so you'll be picked up from your hotel and driven to the national park to begin the adventure. 

You'll first go on a 3.5-hour coastal trek that's considered medium difficulty. I've done this trek before and it is beautiful, which makes the time fly by so it doesn't actually feel this long. 

You'll hike through a forested trail that hugs the shoreline and along the way, you'll come across numerous secret beaches and hidden coves. It's a great opportunity to see wildlife!

The hike is honestly not that challenging; it's a fairly flat trail, though you do encounter a bit of elevation closer to the end. 

Your reward for completing the hike is lunch and drinks in a geodome overlooking the Lapataia River. 

After lunch, it's time to hit the water! This is where you'll board the inflatable vessels (they're more like a raft than a canoe, if you ask me!) and you'll embark on a journey down the Lapataia River, which flows into the sea at Lapataia Bay. 

Lapataia Bay is a pretty cool spot because it's the end of the road at the bottom of the South American continent. There's nowhere to go from here, unless you want to turn around and drive up to Alaska!

PROS:

Combines hiking and canoeing

Includes lunch in a geodome

Small group tour

We travelled around Argentina and Chile for 2 weeks, this was by far the best day trip we did, beautiful hike, fun canoe-ing trip and lots of fun people. Glad we did it!"" -Gina W

2. Tierra del Fuego National Park Half-Day Tour with Lunch and Drinks

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 6 hours | ✅ Book it!

This half-day tour of Tierra del Fuego National Park is a great alternative for visitors who want an overview of the park without committing to any major hikes. 

Maybe you're short on time, maybe you have mobility issues, or maybe the highlights are all you need! Whatever the case, this tour delivers. 

On this tour, you'll get to visit Ensenada Bay (home to this very famous post office!), Lapataia Bay which marks the end of all roads in South America, and Roca Lake which is also known as Acigami Lake and is shared by Argentina and Chile. 

You'll also have the opportunity to walk some of the shorter trails in the Lapataia Bay sector of the park. I walked all 6 of these mini trails in one day and they range between 400 meters and 2 kilometres, so they are very manageable. 

A traditional Argentine lunch will be served in a geodesic dome overlooking the Lapataia River. 

PROS:

Easy walks and beautiful viewpoints in the park

Includes lunch in a geodome

Small group tour

""Tour guide Claudio was fantastic. He really knows the area and is very fluent in both Spanish and English. Two small walks were included in the tour and both were very achievable for us 60-somethings. The lunch was held in a geodesic dome tent within the park. It consisted of cold appetizers, an entree of chicken leg and thigh with rice and moist cake for dessert. Wine, water and Pepsi were offered as beverages. Our mistake was to bring only lightweight waterproof jackets. The weather can shift from sunny and warm to light rain, cold and windy very quickly. We should have also brought warmer jackets and left them in the van when they were not needed."" -Julie R

3. Tierra del Fuego National Park Tour & End of the World Train Ride

⭐️ RATING: 4/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 5.5 hours | ✅ Book it!

This is one of the more popular tour options and that's because it combines a guided visit of Tierra del Fuego National Park with a ride aboard the End of the World Train. 

The tour begins with a hotel pick-up by minivan and you then drive towards the national park. Once you arrive at the End of the World Train Station, you board the Southern Fuegian Railway and travel the last 7 kilometres of the original prisoner’s train route. It is a 50-minute train ride. 

Next, you'll explore the park highlights where you'll have the opportunity to walk some of the shorter trails and enjoy the views from a few different observation points. 

You'll also stop at Ensenada Zaratiegui, where the Post Office at the End of the World is located. Here you can buy postcards, send snail mail, and even get your passport stamped. It's cash only!

This tour has a morning or afternoon option, but I would suggest the morning if you want to make it to the End of the World post office before it closes. The place is run by an older gentleman who keeps his own hours and sometimes closes early, so you've been warned to avoid disappointment!

PROS: 

Includes transportation to and from the park

Guided visit of Tierra del Fuego National Park

Ride the End of the World Train

""Our guide, Carla, is not only knowledgeable but also attentive. Only 3 of us out of 24 passengers were English speaking but she made sure to pay equal attention to us. The tour was beautiful scene one after another. I was disappointed that the fin del mundo post office was closed due to the winter season but well what can we do. I highly recommend this trip especially if your stay in Ushuaia is limited."" -Aya T

4. Tierra del Fuego National Park Tour for Birdwatching

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 8-9 hours | ✅ Book it!

I bet you didn't think there were any Tierra del Fuego National Park tours for birdwatchers, but surprise, there are!

Tierra del Fuego National Park is the only national park in Argentina with a coastline and that means you can see all manner of birds. 

These include the Austral Pygmy Owl, Flightless Steamer Duck, Flying Steamer Duck, Kelp Goose, Andean Tapaculo, Magellanic Oystercatcher, Blackish Oystercatcher, Kelp Goose, Albatross, Imperial Cormorant and Crested Duck, just to name a few!

I'm not even an avid birdwatcher and I was surprised at the number of birds I managed to see hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park. I remember hiking the Senda de la Baliza trail and just as we were about to cross into the dead forest, we heard this loud pecking - it was a beautiful Magellanic woodpecker, and it would be the first of many on our visit. 

So if you consider yourself a bird nerd, this tour is the one for you!

PROS:

Tour geared to birdwatchers

Includes lunch

Combines 4x4 journey and hiking

""We had a great visit with Marcelo bird watching in tierra del fuego park and would highly recommend him. he picked us up at the pier and dropped us off at the airport. in a long day we saw 50 species, including a pair of woodpeckers, most endemics, and a new rarity for the park. Great lunch also. Would highly recommend him. Good pace to the trip."" - A TripAdvisor Reviewer

5. Tierra del Fuego National Park Tour, Beagle Channel & 4x4 Adventure

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 days | ✅ Book it!

This next option is an interesting one because it's a package of 3 tours in Ushuaia. You are essentially booking 3 days worth of tours and it also includes a transfer from the airport to your hotel at the start of the trip, and your hotel to the airport at the end of the trip. 

Basically, you just need to sort your own meals and accommodations, but for the duration of your 3-day trip to Ushuaia, you can be sure you are going on the most iconic tours in the region. 

Day 1 is all about cruising the Beagle Channel, seeing Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse and viewing local wildlife. 

Day 2 is a 4x4 off-road adventure to Lago Escondido. You'll cross the Fuegian Andes Mountains via the legendary Garibaldi Pass and begin your descent down to Escondido Lake, which is only accessible on a 4x4 vehicle, before continuing to Fagnano Lake. 

Lunch will be served in a geodesic dome - Argentinean asado and wine! 

Day 3 is all about enjoying Tierra del Fuego National Park. You'll visit the park with a guide and get to walk some of the shorter trails. You'll also get to visit Lapataia Bay, which marks the end of the Panamericana Road.

If that's not enough, this package even gives you the option of upgrading some of these experiences to include the navigation to Penguin Island and ride the End of the World Train. Read through all the options carefully at the time of booking because you have 4 different choices! 

PROS:

Package of 3 tours in 3 days

Includes airport pick up and drop off

Get to see the best Ushuaia has to offer 

""They were highly responsive to our questions and accommodating to our specific schedule, needs and concerns. We swapped Lago Escondido activity for the Vinciguerra Glacier hike. The staff kept us informed throughout so that every event went as planned, the guides were knowledgeable, friendly, warm, and shared helpful tips to enrich our experience with unexpected memories, like a hot lunch in a glacier cave 2,400 ft high, seeing baby humpbacks at play, foraging through forests and prairies, reminding us to further memorialize our trip with the end of the world postage and passport stamps. I will recommend this team to all who plan to come Ushuaia and will use their services again for any future adventures. Thank you all."" - A TripAdvisor Reviewer

Tips for Your Tierra del Fuego Trip

Dress in layers. The weather at the end of the world is ever-changing and you can experience sunshine, rain, hail and snow all in one day. I would recommend a fleece and a waterproof jacket for your top layers. 

Wear sturdy shoes. Most of these tours include some hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park. The trails can get quite wet and muddy depending on the time of year, so hiking shoes with good grip are ideal. This is no place for sneakers if you're planning to hit the trails. Trekking poles are handy for longer trails. 

Check what's included. Most Tierra del Fuego National Park tours don't include the admission fee to the park in the tour price. This is because the price varies depending on whether you're a local tourist, an out-of-province tourist, or an international tourist. You can also choose between a day pass or a 2-day pass, the latter of which includes a discount. You can view park rates here. Bring cash to pay the admission fee.

For many, reaching Ushuaia in the province of Tierra del Fuego at the very bottom of the South American continent is a bucket list destination, and what better way to commemorate such an achievement than by flying over the city and the surrounding Andes Mountains?

Seeing the city as you fly into the Ushuaia Airport is one thing, but having a helicopter pilot zip you around mountain peaks, over lagoons, and past glaciers, showing off all the best vantage points is something entirely different.

A helicopter tour of Ushuaia may sound like a huge splurge (and it can be!), but there are also shorter and more budget-friendly flights that the average traveller can enjoy.

Yes, you can opt for the champagne celebration atop a mountain if you so choose, but know that there are also short sightseeing flights that are accessible to the average traveller.

So get ready for a helicopter ride over Ushuaia!

Choosing your Ushuaia Helicopter Tour

So you've decided you want to enjoy a scenic flight over Ushuaia during your trip, but now it's time to decide on a tour. Which one should you choose and why?

HeliUshuaia is the helicopter tour provider in Ushuaia offering 3 different tours that vary in length and flight route, so read on to see which one is right for you.

Photo by HeliUshuaia via GetYourGuide

Ushuaia Scenic Tour - 7 minutes

Fasten those seatbelts and get ready for an action-packed 7 minutes of flight time!

This is the shortest Ushuaia helicopter tour and the most budget-friendly option, but it still packs a lot of attractions.

The flight begins heading west for a scenic look at the Beagle Channel before turning east offering postcard-perfect views of the city of Ushuaia framed by the Andes Mountains, the Martial Glacier, Mount Cinco Hermanos and the emblematic Mount Olivia.

You also get a good look at the downtown where you can see buildings like the Presidio (the former prison that gave birth to Ushuaia as a penal colony!) as well as the port area where during the summer months you can spot ships getting ready to depart for Antarctica.

This 7-minute flight offers a good overview of Ushuaia and it's a fun way to get some airtime without breaking the bank.

Photo by HeliUshuaia via GetYourGuide

Emerald Lagoon - 15 minutes

This next option is a 15-minute flight experience that begins by flying over the bay of Ushuaia.

The helicopter then enters the Olivia River Valley to appreciate the majestic Mount Olivia, the picture-perfect mountain that stands 1,326 metres high directly behind the city.

You also see the characteristic Mount Cinco Hermanos, which translates to 'Five Brothers' due to the mountain's distinct five points.

Just when the immensity of the landscape begins to take your breath away, you witness the Carbajal Valley in the Fuegian Andes, known for its peat bogs which formed over thousands of years!

The flight then continues across the valley accessing a second mountain range which hides the crown jewel: Laguna Esmeralda. This lagoon is known for its bright emerald colour due to its glacial origin having been formed from the meltwater of the Ojo del Albino Glacier.

It's a popular day trip from Ushuaia for hikers and in this helicopter tour, you can see it from a bird's eye view!

Photo by HeliUshuaia via GetYourGuide

Landing at the Andes - 30 minutes

How can you possibly top the above Ushuaia helicopter tours?

The answer is: by landing in the heart of the Andes Mountains!

This 30-minute helicopter flight is a splurge to celebrate your trip to the southernmost city in the world, and what a way to do so.

The flight path is the same as the flight to the Emerald Lagoon, however, it then continues flying over Cerro Castor, the southernmost ski centre in the world.

A few moments later, you cross the Encajonado River Valley, and land in the heart of the Andes Mountains, surrounded by peaks all around in a spectacular landscape at the end of the world!

Here you can enjoy a champagne toast and relish in this once-in-a-lifetime experience, because how lucky are you to be standing here surrounded by nature's splendour?

After snapping a few photos with the help of your pilot, it is then time to fly back to Ushuaia.

Things to know before your Ushuaia helicopter tour

Helicopter tours may sometimes need to be rescheduled due to inclement weather.

The helicopter has a weight limit of 264 lbs or 120 kg per passenger.

Well, we've got you covered!

Coastal Patagonia may not get as much attention as its mountainous counterpart, but it offers hundreds of kilometres of beaches and it's one of the best places in Patagonia for wildlife viewing opportunities - we're talking penguins, sea lions, elephant seals, Southern right whales and more!

Plus, coastal Patagonia is also home to a surprising number of Welsh communities seeing as this is where the early Welsh settlers first landed.

Much like with our Northern Patagonia travel itinerary, on this road trip guide we'll be covering places to visit, activities to enjoy, where to stay and more.

This coastal Patagonia travel itinerary features a mix of port cities and seaside towns, so there's plenty of variety.

The coastal route takes 14 days to complete and can be driven from north to south starting in Puerto Madryn, or south to north starting in Comodoro Rivadavia. The choice is yours!

Coastal Patagonia Travel Itinerary

Puerto Madryn

2 days

The first stop on this coastal Patagonia travel itinerary is the port city of Puerto Madryn.

Yes, this city is known as the gateway to Península Valdés and all the wildlife viewing opportunities the destination offers, however, right now we're going to focus on what you can do in the city before you make your way over to the peninsula.

Things to do in Puerto Madryn

Museum of the Man and the Sea

The Museum of the Man and the Sea is housed in the former home of Agustín Pujol, an early pioneer who immigrated from Catalunya and built this beautiful house in 1915.

The museum is spread out across the home’s three floors and focuses on local wildlife both on land and the sea.

Don't miss the giant squid exhibit; it looks like something straight out of Moby Dick!

EcoCentro

The EcoCentro is an interpretive space that looks at man's relationship with the marine ecosystem. It’s a space that combines science and fine arts to raise awareness about our natural world.

The EcoCentro also has a tower that resembles a lighthouse where you can go up and enjoy the views. They have sofas and books, so it's a nice place to linger on a rainy day!

Caves of the Welsh Settlers

When the Welsh first disembarked on the shores of Puerto Madryn in 1865, they set up temporary shelters in the caves that line the coast.

Today, there's also a small museum on-site called Museo del Desembarco Punta Cuevas.

Inside, there's a display of the Mimosa, the ship they sailed on, as well as photographs and items that were brought over from Wales on this quest for a new life.

Comandante Luis Piedra Buena Pier

If you’re looking for a nice sunset stroll, the pier is the place to be!

The Comandante Luis Piedra Buena Pier juts out into the gulf and there are always people fishing, birdwatching, or enjoying a leisurely walk.

It’s not open to the public on cruise days (since this is where passengers disembark by the hundreds), however, if there's no cruise ship docked at the end, you’re good to go.

Where to stay in Puerto Madryn

Hotel Territorio - 4-star luxury hotel situated in the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean

Hotel Península Valdés - 4-star hotel with bright rooms and a beachy feel

Hotel Bahía Nueva - 3-star centrally located hotel with an impressive buffet breakfast and a cosy feel

Day Trips from Puerto Madryn

Without touching on any of the activities on Península Valdés quite yet, here are some of the other day trips you can enjoy from Puerto Madryn.

Snorkelling with Sea Lions – this is a 3-hour excursion to Punta Loma Nature Reserve where you can go snorkelling with sea lions in their own habitat

Punta Tombo Penguin Colony – this is a 9-hour tour to Punta Tombo where penguins come to mate and give birth every year, and there's the option to add on a dolphin-watching tour (weather permitting)

Península Valdés & Puerto Pirámides

3 days

Península Valdés is the highlight of any coastal Patagonia travel itinerary, and while many choose to visit for the day from neighbouring Puerto Madryn, the best way to experience the peninsula is by staying on the peninsula!

And because there's only one town on the whole peninsula, you'll be staying in Puerto Pirámides.

First, we'll cover some of the various destinations you can explore on the peninsula, and then we'll share what there is to see in the actual town.

Things to do in Península Valdés

Istmo Ameghino Interpretation Centre

The first attraction you'll hit is the Istmo Ameghino Interpretation Centre which is located on the narrowing that leads to Península Valdés.

This may not seem like the most exciting stop on the tour when there is wildlife to see, but it does serve as an introduction to the local biodiversity on the peninsula with accompanying facts about each species, their behaviour and migration patterns.

There are also displays of a whale skeleton and the skull of an orca. And there's a lookout point you can climb in hopes of spotting a real whale out in the bay!

Punta Norte

Punta Norte translates to 'north point' and as the name suggests it's the northern point on the peninsula.

There's a boardwalk that leads to the edge of the bluffs where you can typically see sea lions basking in the sun.

Since we visited in mid-February, there were lots of pups splashing in the water and familiarizing themselves with their new surroundings.

There was also a smaller group of elephant seals a bit further down, but it was towards the end of the season for them.

Estancia San Lorenzo

In the northern part of Península Valdés, you'll also find Estancia San Lorenzo. This is a traditional Patagonian sheep ranch that raises Australian merino sheep for wool production.

Depending on the time of year you visit, you can witness different activities related to sheep farming like marking, shearing, and herding with the help of dogs.

The old shearing barn at Estancia San Lorenzo has been turned into a rustic Patagonian-style restaurant, that also features a visitor centre and shop selling local products and souvenirs.

The estancia belongs to the Machinea family of Basque origin that arrived in Península Valdés in 1900.

Estancia San Lorenzo also happens to be home to the largest Magellanic penguin rookery in the world. Hundreds of thousands of penguins mate and nest along these shores.

Their waddling down to the beach will definitely put a smile on your face. It's a pretty epic spot!

Caleta Valdés

Caleta Valdés is located on the eastern shore of Península Valdés and is considered a 'geographic accident'.

The caleta is essentially a long and narrow body of water that has been naturally closed off by a strip of land, with only a small opening connecting it to the sea.

This is generally a good spot to see elephant seals and penguins, though in smaller numbers in comparison to Estancia San Lorenzo.

Punta Delgada

Another spot to visit on Península Valdés is Punta Delgada on the south end of the peninsula.

Punta Delgada is a beach with steep sandy cliffs and it witnesses a high concentration of elephant seals during mating and moulting season (this is when the seals shed their hair and the upper layer of their skin).

A good lunch option is the Punta Delgada Lighthouse, a former post office and military building turned sheep farm, countryside hotel and restaurant.

We ordered empanadas as a starter followed by a Patagonian lamb stew with carrots, onions, rice and parsley. A simple yet wonderful meal.

Things to do in Puerto Pirámides

Boat tour to See Wildlife

First and foremost, if you want to go on a boat tour during your visit to Península Valdés, you'll depart from Puerto Pirámides.

Depending on the time of year you visit, there will be different wildlife viewing opportunities.

We went out on a zodiac-style raft and got to see sea lions sunbathing on the cliffs, and countless sea birds – especially cormorants!

Whale-watching tours are typically from June to December. It’s worth mentioning that the law requires the operators to cut their engine within 100 metres of a whale and they are not permitted to chase them.

Hike the Cliffs 

Puerto Pirámides is surrounded by cliffs that you can hike for epic views.

You can hike up for sunrise, or walk the trail at sea level where you are bound to spot a fossil or two!

Avenida de las Ballenas

Literally 'the Avenue of the Whales', this is the main road in Puerto Pirámides and it is lined with colourful buildings and plenty of street art.

You'll find breweries, cafes, restaurants, and souvenir shops. It's worth a stroll during your visit - just maybe not during siesta time when most places close.

Seafood at La Covacha

Our favourite restaurant in Puerto Pirámides was La Covacha, a laidback restaurant serving seafood and traditional Patagonian dishes.

I got their giant ravioli stuffed with shrimp in a buttery mussel sauce with calamari a la provencal - it was one of the best pasta dishes I had in Patagonia.

Where to stay in Puerto Pirámides

Océano Patagonia Wild Coast Residence - 3-star modern eco-hotel right on the beach

Del Nomade Hostería Ecológica - centrally located eco guest house located on the main road

Estancia San Lorenzo - not in Puerto Pirámides, but you can stay at the estancia we mentioned earlier!

Trelew

3 days

The next stop on this coastal Patagonia road trip is Trelew, a city known for dinosaurs, Welsh culture, and strange links to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Things to do in Trelew

Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum

The Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum has over 30 dinosaurs on display and you can even see dinosaur eggs.

However, no dinosaur is more famous than the Patagotitan Mayorum – the largest dinosaur in the world!

This titanosaur was discovered in 2013 and measures more than 8 metres in height, 40 metres in length, and is estimated to have weighed around 74 tons.

Biggest Dinosaur Sculpture

Speaking of the Patagotitan Mayorum, on the outskirts of Trelew you can visit a massive sculpture of the biggest dinosaur in the world.

It is located directly across from the Trelew Airport about 6 kilometres north of town.

Hotel Touring Club

It may not look like much today but Hotel Touring Club was once considered one of Argentina’s most luxurious hotels. It was constructed in 1898 and remained the 'it' place hosting multiple presidents through the 1930s.

Some of the more famous guests known to have passed through include writer and aviator Antoine de Saint Exupéry of The Little Prince.

And the hotel also welcomed Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Etta Place - the infamous train and bank robbers from the days of the American Wild West. They settled in Patagonia and eventually bought a ranch in Cholila.

There's a cool bar in the hotel that's worth a visit. Order the picada for a tapas-style meal where you can sample a bit of everything!

Regional Museum Pueblo de Luis

If you want to learn about Trelew's history, you can visit the Regional Museum Pueblo de Luis.

The name says it all: 'Pueblo de Luis' is Spanish for 'Town of Lewis', or 'Trelew' in Welsh.

The museum is set in the former railway station which dates back to 1889 and has displays focusing on the Mapuches and the Tehuelches who lived in these lands, followed by the early exploration of the area between 1520 and 1865, and then the arrival of Welsh immigrants.

Here are a few more ideas of things to do in Trelew.

Where to stay in Trelew

Hotel Libertador – a centrally located 3-star hotel close to most attractions offering breakfast.

Apart Hotel Argenta – spacious self-catering apartment-style accommodations with a kitchen, living and dining area.

La Casa de Paula – bed and breakfast set in a residential neighbourhood with a familiar touch.

Day Trips from Trelew

Dolavon

Dolavon translates to ‘river meadow’ and is another Welsh community you can visit in Chubut.

This is a very small, sleepy town that can easily be visited in half a day.

Some of the highlights include walking along the canals, and visiting the old mill turned museum and restaurant.

Bosque Petrificado Florentino Ameghino

If you don’t mind a bit of a drive, you can visit the Florentino Ameghino Petrified Forest.

Here you’ll come face to face with petrified logs that were part of an extensive forest and were carried by rivers to the sea coast of that time.

The tree logs are estimated to date back 60 million years!

Rawson

Rawson was the first town founded by Welsh immigrants who sailed to Patagonia aboard the Mimosa in 1865.

The city sits next to the Chubut River not too far from where it meets the sea.

It's a popular dolphin and whale-watching destination depending on the time of year you visit.

Gaiman

2 days

The next stop on this coastal Patagonia travel itinerary is Gaiman! This is the place to visit if you want to experience a taste of Welsh culture in Patagonia.

Things to do in Gaiman

Welsh Afternoon Tea

The main thing to do in Gaiman is to enjoy Welsh afternoon tea in one of the town’s many tea houses.

Heads up, you'll want to skip lunch and go hungry because there will be a lot of food!

There are plenty of tea houses to choose from, however, the most famous of them all is Ty Te Caerdydd as it hosted Lady Diana during her visit to Argentina in 1995.

But whichever tea house you choose, you can expect to find a similar menu, including a slice of bara brith or ‘Welsh cake’.

Museums in Gaiman

There are several museums you can visit in Gaiman that explore Welsh culture and these include:

Regional History Museum - set in the old train station, this museum displays a variety of items that were brought over by the early Welsh settlers.

First House in Gaiman - this first house to be built of stone dates back to 1874 and belonged to David D. Roberts and his wife Jemima Jones, who became the first settlers of Gaiman.

Tehuelche-Mapuche Museum - formerly known as the Gaiman Anthropological Museum, this museum focuses on the Tehuelches and the Mapuches and their friendship with the Welsh settlers.

Quintas Narlú

This is a beautiful farm that welcomes visitors. Their shop sells homemade jams, freshly picked berries, Welsh bara brith cake, honey, dry lavender bundles, plus all sorts of souvenirs.

You can pick up some cake and berries like we did, and then enjoy a stroll through the apple orchard and have a picnic.

Central Chubut Railway Tunnel

One of Gaiman’s main tourist attractions is the old train tunnel that was part of the Central Chubut Railway. This railway operated between the valley of the Chubut River and the port city of Puerto Madryn.

It was in operation from 1888 until 1961 - making it the first railway in Patagonia! - and it helped cut down travel time since this journey was previously something that had to be done on horseback.

The tunnel is 282 metres in length and inside there are audiovisual displays that share the history of the railway in Spanish, English and Welsh.

Here are some ideas of things to do in Gaiman on a day trip. Though if you have the time, it's worth staying for a night!

Where to stay in Gaiman

Posada Los Mimbres – This is a 3-star hotel located 4 km from the historic district. It offers beautiful gardens, a swimming pool, free bicycles to get around, and a restaurant that serves home-cooked meals.

Hostería Gwesty Plas y Coed – This place offers private rooms in a Welsh-style house in the historic centre of Gaiman.

Comodoro Rivadavia

2 days

The final destination on our coastal Patagonia travel itinerary is Comodoro Rivadavia, but let me warn you, this isn't your typical tourist destination.

In fact, if you tell Argentines you're travelling here, they'll look at you perplexed and wild-eyed.

What could there possibly be to see or do in an oil town?

Well, if you enjoy travelling off the beaten path and experiencing regular everyday towns, this might be up your alley.

It is admittedly a bit of a drive from the other destinations we're covering (4 hours and 30 minutes from Trelew), so the choice is yours.

Things to do in Comodoro Rivadavia

National Petroleum Museum

The top attraction in Comodoro Rivadavia is the National Petroleum Museum. This is an oil town after all!

The museum is located in the General Mosconi neighbourhood about 3 kilometres north of the city centre on the very spot where they first struck oil.

This is a must-do activity in the city as it's a great way to learn about the city's origins. There is a guide on site who will share the history (yes, it's free!) and you're then free to wander around the museum on your own.

There is an outdoor component to the museum where you can view all the machinery that was used to drill for oil.

And then there's an indoor component that has a simulator depicting what it would be like if you could shrink down and travel to the bottom of an oil well. I’m sure it’s an experience meant for children, but it's a lot of fun at any age!

You can read our complete guide of things to do in Comodoro Rivadavia here.

Playa Costanera

Since Comodoro Rivadavia is a seaside city that means you can enjoy some beautiful coastal walks along the Costanera.

We did the walk along Playa Costanera starting from Plaza Soberanía. You go through a bit of an industrial shipping area where you can see some old abandoned boats covered in graffiti, and you eventually reach the beach.

There are also some seafood restaurants right by the beach. Our personal favourite was Cayo Coco del Mar. You can order their seafood platter if you want to sample a bit of everything.

Cerro Chenque

Cerro Chenque is a hill that rises 212 metres above sea level and offers great panoramic views of the city and the coastline facing south.

The name ‘chenque’ means cemetery or grave in the native Pehuenche language, since this was used as a burial ground.

It is possible to walk to the top, but it's a busy road with heavy traffic, so I would suggest asking a taxi to take you up.

Where to stay in Comodoro Rivadavia

Comodoro Hotel – 3-star hotel, centrally located with a lobby bar and buffet breakfast. This is where we stayed!

Lucania Palazzo Hotel – 4-star hotel featuring bright and spacious rooms, a piano bar, gym and sauna.

Austral Hotel – 4-star hotel with an in-house restaurant specializing in seafood dishes and regional cuisine.

Rada Tilly

2 days

The most popular day trip from Comodoro Rivadavia is to the neighbouring beach town of Rada Tilly.

Located just 13 kilometres from Comodoro Rivadavia, Rada Tilly is considered the weekend playground for those with oil money. The beachfront is lined with mansions - some that look like they were inspired by homes on Santorini!

If you're already going to be in Comodoro Rivadavia, it's worth adding Rada Tilly to your coastal Patagonia travel itinerary.

Beach and Wind Sports

Rada Tilly's beaches are super wide at low tide and there are also some pretty impressive cliffs at the far end of town.

The beach is also a popular destination for windsurfing, kitesurfing, and even land sailing – a sport where three-wheeled carts with a sail move using the force of wind.

Rada Tilly also has the distinction of being the southernmost beach resort on the South American continent, so that alone makes it worth a visit!

Where to stay in Rada Tilly

Posada Marina Bella - guesthouse located 4 blocks from the beach

Roots Backpackers - hostel option at the end of town close to the beach

Day trips from Rada Tilly

Punta Marqués

Just past Rada Tilly, you'll find Punta Marqués, which is another popular day trip from Comodoro Rivadavia.

This natural reserve is an opportunity for visitors to see the sea lions that live on the cliffs year-round, though you’ll find the highest concentration of them from October to December.

If you're up for a hike, Punta Marqués is a 6-kilometre walk from the south end of Rada Tilly. However, you can also pay for a taxi to the top and ask them to wait for you.

Coastal Patagonia Travel Itinerary Tips

Distances between certain towns can be hundreds of kilometres without much in sight. Fuel up when you get the opportunity.

Don't go off-roading if your vehicle can't handle it. This part of the world is pretty remote and you don't want to get stranded far away from any sign of civilization. Also, make sure your rental car has a spare tire.

Rental cars in Argentina are almost exclusively standard/manual transmission. Automatic cars are few and far between, and the rental price is typically 3x as much as that of a standard car.

You can travel this coastal Patagonia route by bus. The bus company Via TAC covers the complete route from Puerto Madryn to Comodoro Rivadavia.

That concludes our coastal Patagonia travel itinerary for anyone planning an overland trip.

Can you keep driving further south down coastal Patagonia?

Sure! However, the distances become much longer with few cities or towns in between.

Also, keep in mind that if you want to reach Ushuaia (also known as the southernmost city in the world!), you'll have to go through Chile and then there's a ferry crossing involved to reach the Tierra del Fuego province, which is an island.

Yes, you continue your coastal road trip to the ends of the Earth, it just takes a bit more effort. But if you're up for the adventure, upwards and onwards!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,28b63b94d137dac35eec5d3a392fcdc10ed459d5

Filled with cathedrals, churches, cloisters and crypts, this part of Cordoba feels like a living museum where you'll immediately be transported several centuries back.

Cordoba is Argentina's second-largest city so it can be overwhelming trying to see and do everything on your first trip. However, the Jesuit Quarter offers a glimpse of the city's early beginnings and it's a great introduction for visitors who only have a couple of days in town.

But before we dive into everything there is to see and do in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter, we need to talk about how and why the Jesuits ended up in Argentina.

Exploring Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter in Argentina

History of the Jesuits in Argentina

The Jesuit Order was founded in 1540 by Ignatius de Loyola, a Spanish Catholic priest and theologian.

Also known as the Society of Jesus, this was a religious order whose goals included establishing highly disciplined schools and propagating Catholic beliefs through missionary work.

The Jesuits arrived in what is today Argentina in November 1585, and they settled in Córdoba by 1599 making it a hub for their work; namely, to educate and convert the local native population.

Starting in 1615, the Jesuits developed estancias to fund their work. There were six ranches or farms in the Province of Cordoba, which acted as agricultural and trade centres. Some of the estancias had sawmills, flour mills, vineyards, cattle, orchards, looms, kilns - anything that could produce an income to continue funding their work.

In this manner, the Jesuits gained great power, because even though they were not allowed to accumulate wealth for themselves, they managed to do so for the Order.

This power, along with their firm dedication to the pope in Rome, was a reason for concern for the Catholic monarchs.

The Jesuits' defence of the indigenous populations against abuses committed by Spanish colonizers was also seen as an impediment in establishing absolute monarchist rule.

That is why in 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spain and all of its colonies (including Argentina) following the decree by King Charles III of Spain.

The Jesuits had simply become too powerful and they were seen as a threat, and that is how the Jesuit chapter came to an end.

Tip: While you cannot stay overnight at the historic Jesuit Estancias of Córdoba, you can book a stay at one of the many tourist-friendly estancias in Córdoba set along the Sierras Grandes and Sierras Chicas.

Staying in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

Hotel Virreinato

So, where should you stay in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter?

It’s not often that we share the hotels we stay at, but this place was an experience in and of itself and it was a big part of why we enjoyed our time in the city.

We stayed at Virreinato Hotel Boutique; the name translates to 'viceroyalty' in Spanish, and the hotel is set in a historic home right in the heart of the Jesuit Quarter.

The building dates back to 1670 and the interior was decorated with elaborate furniture and lots of art and antiques; it was like stepping back in time.

Breakfast at Hotel Virreinato in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

The rooms at Hotel Virreinato in Cordoba

The hotel offers guided tours to all guests, and they also open their doors to visitors once a month. During this tour you can learn all about the building’s Jesuit history, and also about the owners who made this place what it is today, filling it with an impressive collection of art from across the globe.

Breakfast surrounded by antiques was a highlight of the trip!

Places to Visit in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

Society of Jesus Church in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

Jesuit Block

Let’s begin our Cordoba city tour where it all began, in the Jesuit Quarter.

The Jesuits arrived in Cordoba and established themselves around the year 1599, and during their time here, they really shaped the city’s landscape, specifically by building lots of churches!

Cordoba's Jesuit Block is made up of the National University of Córdoba, the National College of Our Lady of Montserrat, and the Jesuit Church and Residence.

These are places you can visit independently, or if you prefer exploring with a local, you can join a guided walking tour.

This half-day tour begins in Plaza San Martin which is surrounded by the Cathedral of Cordoba and the Old Town Hall in the city's historic centre.

The tour then covers other highlights in the Jesuit Quarter like the Church of the Company, the Rector of the University, and the National College of Monserrat, plus an optional visit to the Historical Museum.

Inside Cordoba Cathedral

Cordoba Cathedral

The Cathedral of Cordoba, also known as Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, is the oldest church in continuous service in Argentina.

It is also the oldest colonial building in the whole country that it still intact and functional.

Construction began in 1582 and the cathedral was consecrated in 1706, but it wasn't officially finished until 1787.

As you walk in through the massive wooden gates and enter the nave, your eyes are guided up to the the cathedral's impressive central barrel vault ceiling that's embellished with frescoes and lots of gold leaf. The soft lights make everything glow.

The style is Renaissance meets Spanish colonial baroque meets Neoclassical.

Cordoba Cathedral is a National Historic Monument and an invaluable part of Argentina's architectural heritage, plus it's so centrally located on the west end of Plaza San Martin that it's impossible to miss.

El Cabildo or old town hall in Cordoba, Argentina

El Cabildo

Right next to the cathedral, you have the Cabildo which was the colonial equivalent of a town hall.

Prior to the existence of the cabildo, the local government used to meet in members' private homes.

In 1588, construction of an adobe structure with a thatched roof began. This eventually gave way to a framed wood structure in 1610, and in 1786 the current structure was completed.

The only way to tour the whole building is as part of a guided tour that runs around 40 minutes.

The tourist information point is located in the Cabildo, so you can go in and inquire about the tour starting times.

University of Cordoba is the oldest university in Argentina

University of Cordoba

Cordoba is nicknamed 'la Docta' or 'the Wise' thanks to the number of universities spread across the city. (There are 8, in case you were wondering!)

The National University of Cordoba, or Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, is the oldest university in Argentina and the third oldest in the Americas.

The university was founded in 1613 and it remained the only university in the whole country for over two centuries.

Its precursor was the Collegium Maximum which was founded in 1610 by the Society of Jesus and was attended by the students of the order. So as you can see, there's a lot of history in this place!

We happened to walk past the university's law faculty during one of our strolls through the Jesuit Quarter and we caught a glimpse of the beautiful courtyard. We asked the security guard if we could walk in and apparently, it's open to the public, so we enjoyed a visit.

Plaza San Martin in Cordoba

Plaza San Martín

Another place to visit in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter is Plaza San Martín.

This is the central square and it pays homage to José de San Martín, who led South America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire.

He is known for liberating Argentina, as well as Chile along with O'Higgins and Peru with Bolívar. He is the most important Argentine founding father and this square is dedicated to his memory.

The plaza is lined with benches and palm trees offering shade, and it's a nice place to give your legs a break in between all the sightseeing.

Visiting the Jesuit Crypt in Cordoba

The Jesuit Crypt sits underneath Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

Jesuit Crypt

The ruins of this Jesuit Crypt sit underground beneath the modern-day streets of Cordoba.

This place was originally designed as a noviciate, which was later converted into a crypt and crematorium.

It was abandoned after the Jesuit expulsion, and the discovery of the crypt only took place when the national phone company began digging to extend its phone lines, and this is what they came across.

Access to the crypt is on either side of the pedestrian street Rivera Indarte, where it meets Avenida Colón.

The crypt regularly hosts music nights and art exhibits so that's something else you can ask about when you visit in person.

Society of Jesus Church in Cordoba

Society of Jesus Church

You're probably sensing a theme here; Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter is filled with cathedrals, crypts and churches - and we have another one for you!

Another church not to miss is the Society of Jesus Church, locally known as Iglesia Compañía de Jesús.

This church was built between 1640 and 1676, and it is shaped like a cross with a large dome where the nave intersects the transept.

It is dimly lit, but you can see paintings hanging on either side of the nave leading towards an impressive altar.

The courtyard in the Museum of Religious Art Juan de Tejeda

Museum of Religious Art Juan de Tejeda

Even if you’re not into religious art, I would recommend visiting the Museum of Religious Art Juan de Tejeda for the architecture alone.

This building dates back to colonial times when it was owned by Juan de Tejeda, a local dignitary and wealthy merchant who lived in this sought-after location directly across the cathedral.

In 1625, Tejeda donated his home in order to create a cloistered convent. This was done as an act of gratitude to Saint Teresa of Ávila after Tejeda's daughter had a miraculous recovery from a fatal disease.

The priory of the Carmelite Sisters started operating out of here in 1628.

The museum's exhibition rooms centre around a beautiful courtyard filled with orange and lemon trees, hydrangeas, and jasmines.

Inside, you can see various religious artefacts and sacred relics that come from the Cathedral’s treasury and the San José Monastery.

Where to Eat in Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Solar de Tejeda 🇦🇷 (@solardetejeda) 

Solar de Tejeda

For traditional Argentine food, you can't miss out on Solar de Tejeda.

This restaurant is located in a historic building featuring a long gallery with arched doorways and high ceilings, and you can opt for indoor or al fresco dining.

For a taste of Argentina's BBQ, you can order from the 'Parrilla' section which features various cuts of steak, chorizo and morcilla (blood sausage). You can order the 'parrillada' if you'd like a selection of various cuts of meat.

We opted for one of their homemade pastas, ravioli in a four-cheese sauce; and locro, which is a traditional lentil stew from the northern part of the country.

For dessert, you can't go wrong with flan and a dollop of dulce de leche on top!

Address: 27 de Abril 23

Marmol Siglo 17

Marmol Siglo 17 is a very cool building full of Jesuit history. What is a restaurant today was once a Jesuit dining hall.

We ate at this restaurant a couple of times over the course of our visit to Cordoba.

One evening we ordered the charcuterie board with deli meats, cheeses, pickled vegetables, leberwurst, bread and paired it with a bottle of red wine.

We then went back and tried their fancy salads. There's one that comes with avocado, leafy greens, grilled veggies, pickled onion, beetroot, sweet potatoes, and a mix of seeds.

But if you're looking to try some of their signature dishes, you can opt for the wild boar tomahawk steak, the fried four-cheese sorrentinos, or the mustard pork loin.

For dessert, their brownie with dulce de leche, merengue and fresh berries is divine!

Address: Duarte Quirós 175

La Compañia

The city can get pretty hot during the summer months and you'll likely want to find a cool shaded spot at some point during the course of the day; La Compañia is a nice option in the heart of Cordoba's Jesuit Quarter.

The cobbled courtyard features al fresco dining surrounded by lush vegetation, there's a water fountain offering a soothing melody, and most importantly it's cool and shaded.

We sat down and chugged down lemonades like two wanderers who'd reached an oasis in the desert, but they do have meal options as well.

Address: Caseros 88

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alfajores, dulces & confituras (@lapailacba) 

La Paila

Technically, La Paila isn't a restaurant, but it's the place to visit if you want to stock up on traditional Argentine sweets!

A few treats you won't want to miss include:

Conitos: little peaks of dulce de leche set atop a cookie base covered in a chocolate glaze

Nueces confitadas: walnuts coated in dulce de leche and covered in a sugar glaze

Alfajor cordobés de membrillo: two cookie layers filled with a quince jam filling and covered in a sugar glaze

They have so many different types of alfajores that we ordered a dozen and asked them to give us one of each: with dulce de leche and a chocolate glaze, Santafesino style, meringue alfajor, coconut with a chocolate base, with sugarcane, you name it!

Plus, they also sell jams! If you want to try a unique flavour, go for cayote, or chayote in English.

Address: Duarte Quirós 185

Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba

While the Jesuit Block sits in the centre of Córdoba, that's only one piece of the Jesuit history puzzle. Scattered across the Province of Cordoba there were also Jesuit estancias that funded the missionary work carried out by the Society of Jesus.

These included:

Estancia of Alta Gracia

Estancia of Jesús María

Estancia of Santa Catalina

Estancia of Caroya

Estancia of La Candelaria

Estancia San Ignacio (only ruins)

The majority of these estancias now house museums and are open to visitors with the exception of Estancia San Ignacio where only ruins remain.

The Jesuit Block and the Estancias of Cordoba were declared part of the Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2000. They illustrate the unique religious, social, and economic experiment that was carried out for a period of over 150 years during the 17th and 18th centuries.

So, if you're interested in doing a more in-depth tour of Cordoba's Jesuit past, renting a car and road-tripping the province is a good way to do so!

Getting to Cordoba

As Argentina’s second-largest city, Cordoba is well-connected to the rest of the country and offers multiple flights, buses and even trains that connect it with other major cities.

If you’re flying into Cordoba, you’ll arrive at Ingeniero Aeronáutico Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport, locally known as Pajas Blancas. This airport receives a handful of international flights from Europe and Latin America, plus flights from all over Argentina.

Terminal de Ómnibus de Córdoba is the bus terminal with two terminals where you can catch cross-country buses to almost every corner of the country, as well as regional buses to the Sierras and beyond.

There's also a train that runs twice a week from Buenos Aires to Cordoba if you prefer slow travel. It's a 21-hour journey aboard the Retiro-Córdoba line operated by Trenes Argentinos.

This is the most popular excursion you can do from the capital city of San Miguel de Tucumán and for good reason! Tucumán may be the smallest province in Argentina, but it is packed with culture, history and natural beauty.

On our tour of Tafí del Valle and the Quilmes Ruins we experienced a myriad of landscapes ranging from lush jungles to arid deserts, we visited mysterious monolithic stone carvings, we sampled regional deli meats and cheeses, we stood under the shade of an 800-year-old cactus, plus we explored some of the largest pre-Columbian ruins in all of South America!

It was a great introduction to what Tucumán had to offer, and now we're going to share what you can expect from this day trip.

How to visit Tafí del Valle & Quilmes Ruins

Seeing as Tucumán is the smallest province in Argentina, you can see quite a bit of it in one day!

For this particular route, you can either rent a car and drive yourself, hire a private driver for the day, or join a guided group tour.

We hired a driver since there were 3 of us, however, it was the same itinerary you would do with a tour.

This Tafí del Valle and Quilmes Ruins Tour covers everything we did that day. It's a 10-hour tour so don't make any other plans for the day!

Alternatively, this tour combines Tafí del Valle, Quilmes Ruins and Cafayate, which is a popular wine destination in Northern Argentina. This is a 12-hour tour, so a bit longer, however, you can opt to stay in Cafayate and continue your travels around Salta from there.

There is also a half-day tour to Tafí del Valle, however, it skips over the impressive Quilmes Ruins, so unless you're pressed for time, I'd suggest the former.

Monumento al Indio

The drive out of San Miguel de Tucumán goes up into the Yungas, the temperate slopes of the Andes Mountains where you get a rainy, humid, and warm climate.

The vegetation was lush, green and dense with low-hanging clouds - a completely different setting from the city we had just left behind.

The first stop of our tour was El Chasqui, which means 'messenger' in the Quechua language and refers to the messengers of the Inca Empire who would transport messages via relay runners.

Chasquis were selected from the fittest young males who were known to be the fastest runners, and they were responsible for transporting oral messages, gifts and quipu (a recording device consisting of knotted strings which carried encoded information).

This 6-metre tall monument pays homage to the indigenous peoples who called this valley home. Locals refer to the statue as Monumento al Indio or Monument to the Indian.

El Chasqui is a popular roadside stop where you get sweeping views of the valley, plus there's also a roadside market where you can grab a snack or pick up a few Argentine gifts and souvenirs (though this is only the beginning of your souvenir shopping opportunities).

Los Menhires

The next place we visited on our Tucumán tour was Los Menhires Archaeological Reserve.

The word 'menhir' refers to a human-made standing stone which can be found individually or in a cluster.

Los Menhires is home to a collection of 50 carved stones that were found scattered across the Tafí Valley, and were then moved to an archaeological reserve in the town of El Mollar.

These megaliths were created by the Tafí culture, and feature human faces, llamas, and symbols of fertility.

When these standing stones were in their original locations, the majority of them faced east towards the sun signifying their connection to Inti, the ancient Incan sun god.

However, this is a detail that was not respected when they were relocated to the archaeological park, so you'll notice they face in various directions, generally towards the centre of the park.

Tafí del Valle

Tafí del Valle is a popular destination for anyone travelling through the Province of Tucumán.

The town is located in the Tafí Valley which divides the Sierra del Aconquija to the south and the Cumbres Calchaquíes to the north.

The town is very walkable and it has an abundance of artisanal shops, so it's a great place to pick up some souvenirs; you'll find clay pots, hand-woven baskets, textiles and more.

The town is also known for its cheese festival, so we had to buy (and immediately try) some of their chimichurri cheese.

Chimichurri is a condiment typically served with meat and includes spices like finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, and oregano.

After purchasing our cheese, we went to a bakery for some fresh bread and then we sat on the sidewalk enjoying a midmorning snack. We even befriended a dog in the process!

We spent our time in Tafí del Valle browsing the shops on the main thoroughfare, however, you could opt to visit La Banda Jesuit Museum instead.

This former Jesuit Estancia is a National Historic Monument and it has been turned into a museum to preserve the architectural and cultural heritage of the area.

It houses artifacts belonging to the Tafí and Santa María cultures, paintings from the 18th century, as well as furniture and other Jesuit objects.

Mirador El Infiernillo

Mirador el Infiernillo translates to the 'lookout to hell'.

A bit of a dramatic name, but it is located at 3,042 metres above sea level, so maybe whoever named this place wasn’t feeling their best - hello, altitude sickness!

Mirador el Infiernillo is the highest traversable pass in the province of Tucumán, so we stopped to take photos.

There's a small roadside ranch on the side of the road where there may or may not be someone selling handicrafts that day (no set schedules around these parts!), and also urging you to take a photo with a llama.

Grandfather Cactus

The grandfather cactus is an 800-year-old cactus that sits in Cuesta De Los Cardones along Provincial Route 307.

Apparently, this type of cactus - known as a cardón in Spanish - only grows between 1-1.5 centimetres per year.

This one stands over 8 metres tall, so it's considered the grandfather of all the other cacti in the area.

The landscape is otherworldly - dry, arid and dotted with cardones as far as the eye can see.

Amaicha del Valle

The town of Amaicha del Valle marked our lunch stop of the day.

We ate at a restaurant called Warmy Sonkoy, on the side of the road, where we ordered humitas, tamales and empanadas - as you do when you're travelling in northern Argentina!

Their empanada trio was pretty tasty and featured a beef, chicken, and corn mozzarella empanada.

If you have a bit more time in Amaicha del Valle or you happen to be road-tripping and are on your own schedule, then make time to visit the Museo Pachamama.

This interpretation centre is the work of indigenous artist Héctor Cruz and it seeks to pay homage to Mother Earth.

Inside, the museum is divided into 4 sections highlighting geology, ethnology, tapestries and paintings.

There's also an outdoor component in the form of a sculpture park featuring stone sculptures of Pachamama, Mother Earth; Inti, the Sun God; and Quilla, the Moon Goddess.

Amaicha del Valle is also home to numerous artisan workshops where you can purchase handicrafts, it boasts a couple of vineyards should you be interested in a wine tasting (Bodega Artesanal Marcos Pastrana, Bodega Artesanal Felix Olivares, and Finca El Chañaral), and it's a sleepy destination if you're looking for a couple of days of rest and relaxation.

Quilmes Ruins

The Sacred City of Quilmes is located in the Calchaquí Valleys and it was once the site of the largest pre-Hispanic settlement in all of Argentina.

Dating back to 850 AD, this site occupied 30 hectares at the foot of Cerro Alto del Rey, and at its height, it was home to around 5,000 people.

The Quilmes were an indigenous tribe that settled in the western sub-Andean valleys of the Province of Tucumán in Northwestern Argentina.

They fiercely resisted the Inca invasions of the 15th century, and later resisted the Spaniards for 130 years before being defeated in 1667.

The Quilmes were then exiled by the Spaniards in a dramatic exodus where the remaining 2,000 survivors were forced to walk 1,200 kilometres across the country to Buenos Aires.

It is estimated that little over 400 Quilmes survived the harrowing journey and those who did later succumbed to diseases that were unknown to them.

When the Quilmes arrived in what is today the city of Quilmes just 35 kilometres south of Buenos Aires, they found a geography that was completely different from what they had known back in Tucumán.

Here, they were settled along the wetlands on the shores of the Río de la Plata, where their sacred algarrobo tree did not grow and that was their source of food, drink and firewood.

Furthermore, the medicinal herbs they knew in Tucumán did not grow in this foreign terrain, and that made it difficult for them to heal.

By 1810, the Quilmes Reserve was abandoned as a result of it having become a ghost town.

Today, there are only a few Quilmes left in Tucumán Province.

If you want to learn more about the history of the Quilmes it's worth hiring one of the local guides at the archaeological site and touring alongside them. You can also visit the museum Centro de Interpretación en la Ciudad Sagrada de Los Quilmes.

Back to San Miguel de Tucumán

After visiting the Ruins of Quilmes we began the drive back to San Miguel de Tucumán, a 3 hour and 15 minute journey.

We drove along a small stretch of Ruta Nacional 40 - the iconic highway that crosses the length of Argentina from north to south - and then back along Provincial Route 307, which was the same way we had come.

The drive back honestly didn't feel that long. We got to enjoy the ever-changing landscapes, plus we also dozed off a bit, and before we knew it we were back in the city.

That evening we enjoyed a nice stroll along Plaza Independencia, the central square which is flanked by ornate colonial buildings, before going out to dinner.

If you can spare half a day to explore San Miguel de Tucumán in between the various day trips the province has to offer, it's really worth doing so. The historic centre is quite beautiful!

“Why would you need a train at the end of the world?” you ask. Well, Ushuaia was initially developed as a penal colony for repeat offenders with the first prisoners arriving in 1884.

After being sent to the very bottom of Patagonia at the end of the South American continent, the prisoners were put to work building their own prison, which meant transporting rock and timber from the nearby forests to the town, first using oxen-pulled wagons, and eventually this narrow gauge railway.

Back then, this was known as the Train of Prisoners, and the prisoners had to complete the journey twice a day to and from the logging camps.

Today, the Train at the End of the World has been developed into a heritage train and it’s considered the southernmost functioning railway in the world. It’s a must-do excursion in Ushuaia - even more so if you’re a train enthusiast!

Where does the End of the World Train go?

The train runs from the End of the World train station to the Tierra del Fuego National Park train station.

The departure point is located 8 kilometres west of Ushuaia, so don't make the mistake of thinking you'll be departing from the city.

How soon should you book tickets for the End of the World Train?

Tickets aboard the train at the end of the world can get booked up several weeks in advance, especially if you're travelling during high season.

It is best to secure these tickets well in advance, as soon as you have confirmed your travel dates for Ushuaia.

Is admission to Tierra del Fuego National Park included on the End of the World Train?

The entrance to the national park is not included in the train ticket price and must be paid in cash on the day of the ride.

If you booked this through a tour operator, you'll want to check with them directly as to whether they've included the park fee.

What language is the End of the World Train audio guide in?

During your journey you'll be given headphones so you can learn about the history of Ushuaia, the train, and the role the prisoners played.

Booking a guided tour

Another option is to book a guided tour that includes the End of the World Train and Tierra del Fuego National Park. This particular tour includes transportation from select pick-up points (you'll need to check if your hotel in Ushuaia is one on the list or alternatively choose the pick-up point closest to you).

As part of this tour, you ride the train, visit the national park, stop at Bahia Ensenada Zaratiegui where you can send mail from the Post Office at the End of the World, you reach Bahia Lapataia which marks the end of the Panamerican Highway, and you also visit the Green Lagoon Viewpoint and Lago Roca.

If you don't feel too confident in your Spanish language skills or you just want an easy day, this is a good option.

Train Ride to the End of the World

So what exactly do you get to see when you're riding the train at the end of the world?

Well, here is a list of the attractions covered during the journey.

The End of the World Train Station

The train journey begins at the End of the World train station, which is located 8 kilometres west of the city of Ushuaia. The railway then travels along the Pico Valley in the Toro Gorge.

Burnt Bridge

Next, the train crosses Puente Quemado, which translates to 'Burnt Bridge'. It is named so because of the burnt remains of the old bridge which lie underneath the new tracks.

This part of the journey takes you across Cañadón del Toro or the 'Bull's Canyon' and over the Pipo River, which is formed by meltwater descending from the mountains and flowing to the Beagle Channel.

This is a very scenic part of the journey and we were even lucky enough to see horses grazing next to this pristine river.

La Macarena Waterfall Station

La Macarena Station is the only stop on this train journey. This is a historical point as it's where the prisoners used to stop to refill the water tanks for the steam locomotive La Coqueta.

Here passengers have the chance to disembark and hike up to a waterfall formed by meltwater, and there's also a viewpoint offering views of the Pipo River and some of the surrounding peaks.

This station is also where you can view the photos you took with the 'prisoners' before boarding the train, and if you'd like one as a souvenir, they'll print it for you.

Once it's time to board the train again, you hear a whistle calling passengers back to the train.

National Park Boundary

As you continue the train journey, you eventually come across a sign that announces the boundary of Tierra del Fuego National Park.

This is the only national park in Argentina that has maritime coasts, forests and mountains.

Tree Cemetery

Then, you reach the tree cemetery - a graveyard of trees that were cut by the prisoners who quite literally built their own prison and also supplied Ushuaia with firewood in the early days.

You'll notice that the tree stumps stand about half a meter from the ground - a sign that some of the logging was done in winter when the snow would have been packed pretty deep.

Of course, all this logging was done before the area was designated a national park, but it's part of the history of the place.

National Park Station

The final stop aboard the train at the end of the world is the National Park Station. This is where the train repositions to begin the journey back.

Travellers have the option of disembarking here - maybe you booked an excursion that includes a guided tour through Tierra del Fuego National Park, or maybe you want to spend the day hiking independently.

As mentioned earlier, do keep in mind that if you are travelling independently, you'll need to find your own way back into town - either by pre-arranging a shuttle, calling a taxi or hitchhiking.

Is the train journey worth it?

If you enjoy quirky train rides, then yes!

There are so many epic train journeys in Argentina - the Old Patagonian Express, the Train to the Clouds, the Tren Patagónico - and the Train at the End of the World is another one to add to the list.

Yes, this is a very short journey that only travels a total of 7 kilometres, but it has a very interesting history and it brings you to a beautiful place at the end of the South American continent.

That makes it worth it in our books.

Getting to Ushuaia is quite the undertaking, so you may as well enjoy the activities Tierra del Fuego has to offer!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,0c6470660733ec75c4b8b5c1abdfbc0d75d0e0e5

I have made it my mission to visit as many estancias as possible across Argentina and especially across Patagonia, so I couldn't miss out on a visito to Estancia Nibepo Aike, one of the more famous working ranches in the outskirts of El Calafate.

Estancia Nibepo Aike is open to day visitors and overnight guests. I visited the estancia on a day trip and got to watch the gauchos herd sheep, attend a sheep shearing demonstration, hike in the property which is set in Los Glaciares National Park, marvel at the milky blue waters of Lago Argentino, and enjoy a feast of an asado! 

I'll be the first to admit that staying overnight at an estancia is always more fun as you get to relax, unwind and experience rural life. However, if you're pressed for time, a day trip is a great alternative.

Spending the day at Estancia Nibepo Aike was a change of pace from El Calafate and I really enjoyed, so I'm going to share my experience with you to help you decide if a day at this Patagonian ranch is right for you!

Our Pick

Nibepo Aike Ranch Day

Spend a full or half-day in Estancia Nibepo Aike in Los Glaciares National Park and experience Patagonian rural life on this day tour from El Calafate. 

Getting to Estancia Nibepo Aike

There are a few different ways to get to Estancia Nibepo Aike, but one thing is for sure, it's going to be a bumpy ride! You have to travel down dirt roads most of the way and these roads are often in rough condition, so get ready to experience the washboard effect.

If you're planning to stay overnight at Estancia Nibepo Aike and you've rented a car in El Calafate, then you can make your own way there travelling down Provincial Route 15. If you're planning to spend the night but you don't want to drive, you can arrange transportation in advance through the estancia.

Alternatively, if you're visiting for the day, you can join either a half-day or full-day estancia excursion, which includes transportation to and from El Calafate by minivan. This was how we travelled and we really enjoyed the scenery along the way - if you're lucky you might even see guanacos!

The journey from El Calafate to Estancia Nibepo Aike is 55 kilometres, which isn't a lot, but it takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes given the road conditions.

History of Estancia Nibepo Aike

The story of Estancia Nibepo Aike begins at the turn of the 20th century, when Santiago Peso, a Croatian immigrant arrived and settled in the lands along the southern arm of Argentino Lake. It would still be a few years before this area became what is today Los Glaciares National Park.

Santiago settled around 20,000 hectares together with some partners and founded what was then known as Estancia La Jerónima. Here he began raising sheep and cattle.

In 1924, during a trip to the city of Río Gallegos, Santiago met María Martinic, a young woman from his homeland, Croatia, whom he married the following year.

Together, they had four children: Adolfo, who sadly passed away a year and a half later; Radoslava, nicknamed Niní; Ángela, nicknamed Bebe; and María, nicknamed Porota.

After Santiago fell ill with tuberculosis and eventually passed away, his wife decided to rename the estancia in honour of their 3 daughters. 

The name Nibepo Aike came to be by taking the first letters of the girls' nicknames which were Niní, Bebe and Porota to form 'Nibepo' and adding the Tehuelche word 'Aike' which means 'Place of'.

Visiting Estancia Nibepo Aike

When it comes to visiting Estancia Nibepo Aike on a day trip from El Calafate, you have two options: a full-day tour or a half-day tour. Full-day tours obviously depart in the mornings, and half-day tours often depart both in the mornings and afternoons (depending on the time of year and demand).

If you visit the estancia on a full-day tour, you'll arrive in time for a country breakfast. You'll then attend a sheep shearing demonstration. That will be followed by a traditional barbecue lunch, known as an asado around these parts, accompanied by red wine. Finally, in the afternoon, you'll go on a 3-hour horseback ride through Los Glaciares National Park. 

If you visit on a half-day tour, you'll enjoy a similar itinerary but with a shorter horseback ride of 1 hour. Honestly, if you're not an experienced horseback rider, 1 hour is plenty! At least that's how my knees feel. 

And if you don't want to horseback ride, you can enjoy the trails at the estancia - walk down to the shores of Lago Argentino to see the icy blue waters or walk up the hill for panoramic views.

My Ranch Experience at the Estancia

We did the afternoon tour and arrived just in time for merienda, which is the equivalent of afternoon tea. There was a table set up with tea, coffee, and an array of cakes, pastries and a salty fried dough known as torta frita.

Once we were well-fed, we headed out with our guide to explore the estancia. There was an option to go horseback riding, but we opted to do a hike. (We had done a lot of horseback riding in Argentina at this point!)

During our hike, we got to see a giant hare, stroll the shores of Lago Argentino which has milky blue waters, and try calafate berries. Local lore says that if you eat these berries you'll come back to Patagonia so eat up! The berries weren't quite ripe yet, but that didn't stop us from having some to aid our return. 

Then we all gathered to watch the esquila which is the sheep shearing demonstration. I was impressed by the skill of the gauchos who do this work. They were so gentle with the sheep and you could see that the animal was relaxed during the process. 

Lastly, it was time for dinner. We enjoyed a traditional Patagonian lamb barbecue, plus chorizo, salad and bread rolls. 

The food portions were abundant! They came around offering us various cuts of meat multiple times until we had to decline because we just couldn't eat anymore. 

We were also given our own bottle of wine to share (between myself and my husband). 

And when we thought we were done, it was time for dessert! We managed to find a little bit of room to enjoy flan with dulce de leche. 

We then had some free time after dinner to walk around the estancia, snap some photos, and befriend a few of the working ranch dogs. It was a great way to end the day!

If I had to come up with one point of criticism it would be that once we arrived at the estancia, our small group got combined with another large group of visitors. 

This large group of international visitors was teetering a fine line between tipsy and drunk by the time they reached the estancia. It certainly didn't help that after having wine for lunch, they pulled out bottles of vodka from their backpacks. Let's just say it was a bit rowdy...

Now, this isn't a point of criticism for the estancia or the tour operators, because what can they really do about a large group of adults misbehaving? 

I think this was just an isolated incident that coincided with the day of our visit, but I wanted to be honest about our experience. Aside from that, it was a great day and I would recommend this day trip to anyone travelling in El Calafate. 

Other excursions at Estancia Nibepo Aike

So far we've talked about the classic day trip to Estancia Nibepo Aike, however, there are a few other options to consider. 

Horseback riding to Hidden Glaciers: This is a 5-day / 4-night or 4-day / 3-night excursion on horseback with the first night at the lodge before continuing to an outpost. 

Navigation to the Glaciers: From the ranch, you can embark on two navigations to explore different corners of Los Glaciares National Park.

Los Baguales Trekking: This is a 3-day / 2-night excursion with an overnight stay in a ranch post where you can enjoy a rugged Patagonian experience and visit some epic lakes and glaciers. 

These three excursions are currently operated by Glaciar Sur Aventura.

Spending the night at Estancia Nibepo Aike

If you want to stay the night, I would recommend booking your stay at The Lodge in Estancia Nibepo Aike for the end of your visit to El Calafate. 

Stay in El Calafate at the start of your trip so you can do all the sightseeing around Los Glaciares National Park, see the Perito Moreno Glacier, go on a glacier trek or glacier boat tour, do your souvenir shopping in town and get it all out of your system, because once you arrive at the estancia, you won't want to leave!

Also, given how remote the estancia is, you won't want to be travelling back and forth from El Calafate for different tours and activities. You're coming to Estancia Nibepo Aike to disconnect, enjoy nature, go horseback riding, and learn about life on a working ranch. 

I would suggest giving yourself at least 2 days at the estancia with zero plans to go elsewhere. 

The lodge itself has 10 rooms and offers full room and board for guests. That means breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, so you'll be well-fed. 

Keep in mind that the estancia welcomes visitors seasonally from mid-September to mid-May.

You can visit Estancia Nibepo Aike's official website for information on how to book your stay.

I always say that for a true taste of Patagonia, you need to experience at least one estancia, and if you're travelling to El Calafate, you've got several to choose from!

""What is an estancia?"" you might ask.

In Argentina, an estancia is a vast tract of private land used for farming or rearing sheep and cattle. These estancias can be found across the country and they range from working ranches that welcome guests to more luxurious lodges that have switched their focus to tourism. This makes them a fun alternative to staying in hotels.

One of the benefits of staying at one of the many estancias in El Calafate is that you'll get to enjoy some of the best scenery in all of Patagonia.

Many of the estancias in the area are located within the boundaries of Los Glaciares National Park since they predate the park's existence, and even the ones that are outside the park limits have privileged views of lakes, mountains or the steppe. 

We've selected 5 of the best El Calafate estancias and they each offer something a little bit different. But one thing is for sure, whichever you choose, you'll get to experience a glimpse of rural Patagonia and the gaucho way of life!

1. EOLO - Patagonia's Spirit

EOLO is a luxury estancia and Relais & Chateaux property located halfway between El Calafate and Los Glaciares National Park. It sits on 10,000 acres of land, which adds to the feeling of seclusion in the enormity of Patagonia. 

Eolo is the Spanish name for Aeolus, the Greek god of wind, which is a very apt name for this windswept property in the middle of the Patagonian steppe. 

EOLO offers a boutique experience with only 17 rooms. Guests can choose between the Superior Rooms, which offer views of the lake, steppe, or mountains; the Superior Rooms, which are larger and have a second window with views of the gardens; and the Corner Rooms, which are the highest category.

There are no televisions in the rooms since the goal is for guests to connect with the natural environment and fellow guests. However, there is WiFi access covering all hotel areas free of charge.

While EOLO does not have a spa, it does have a dry sauna, steam sauna, outdoor jacuzzi and massage room.

The estancia has its very own on-site restaurant where guests can enjoy 4 meals per day: breakfast, lunch, tea time and dinner. The restaurant is headed by chef Juan Pablo Bonaveri, who combines the flavours brought over by European immigrants with native Patagonian culinary traditions.

With so much land to explore, guests can enjoy a variety of activities at the estancia like horseback rides, mountain biking or hikes to Cerro Frias or Laguna de los Flamencos, which are included with your stay.

Of course, Los Glaciares National Park is right there waiting to be explored! Additional activities can be booked like boat tours to the glaciers, ice trekking, and kayaking, or you can explore the boardwalks around Perito Moreno Glacier.

EOLO is a seasonal property that's only open from early October to the end of April. That means you can experience spring, summer and autumn, but it closes during the winter months, given the extreme weather and its remote location.

""Seemless perfection. From booking to pick up, ease of planning and organizing our excursions, Eolo exceeded my expectations. Hotel location high on hill with sweeping views of beautiful surrounding plains, mountains, and spectacular Lago Argentino. 5* dining, incredibly helpful and willing staff, only 17 rooms--very well done! Even the weather cooperated."" - Linda from USA

2. Estancia Cristina

Estancia Cristina is a remote estancia located inside Los Glaciares National Park and getting there is quite the adventure!

The journey begins by flying into El Calafate, the closest town to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field and the gateway to the park. 

This is followed by a 45-kilometre overland transfer to Puerto Punta Bandera, where you board a boat for a 2 to 3-hour navigation across Lago Argentino that will bring you to Estancia Cristina.

Given its location, Estancia Cristina is the only property that has a land-based lookout point to the Upsala Glacier, the Mariano Moreno Mountain Range and the Southern Patagonian Ice Field.

The estancia has 20 rooms spread out across 5 casas or houses surrounding the main lodge. The houses are named Mountain, Steppe, Forest, River and Family.

The main lodge, Octógono, is octagonal-shaped and houses the restaurant and gathering place where guests can relax or mingle.

Several activities are included in the stay rate, like an expedition to the Upsala Glacier, plus numerous guided hikes that lead to waterfalls, lagoons and glaciers (all varying in length and level of difficulty).

Estancia Cristina offers a full board program where all meals and non-alcoholic beverages are included. 

Considering its remote location, there is no cell phone signal or Wi-Fi service at Estancia Cristina. You are coming here to truly disconnect and be at one with raw, untamed nature. 

Estancia Cristina is open from October 1st to April 30th and then closes for the season from May 1st to September 30th.

Note: Estancia Cristina offers a day visitors program known as Wild Visits featuring 4 different itineraries focused on trekking, horseback riding, Upsala Glacier or a classic adventure. You can contact them here for more information.

""The staff, the facilities and the location, it was just perfection. We felt welcomed from the very moment we set foot on the boat where we had the whole floor to ourselves and were offered coffee/tea and medialunas. The journey there was simply magnificent, and so were the views from the estancia. Our room was gorgeous with beautiful authentic decor and a spacious, elegant bathroom. We loved in particular the attention to simplicity and sustainability. We took part in three activities: two hikes and one horseback ride. All of them were very well organised and with professional and friendly staff who were very knowledgeable about the area and its history. It was an amazing experience and we couldn't recommend it enough."" - Elena from Hungary

3. Estancia Nibepo Aike

Estancia Nibepo Aike is another famous estancia on the outskirts of El Calafate and it is beautifully situated in Los Glaciares National Park. 

This estancia was started at the turn of the 20th century by Santiago Peso, a Croatian immigrant. He settled some 20,000 hectares together with his partners and began raising sheep and cattle. 

Back then, this place was known as Estancia La Jerónima. However, the estancia was later renamed Nibepo Aike in honour of the founder's daughters. 'Nibepo' comes from taking the first letters of the girls’ nicknames - Niní, Bebe and Porota - and ‘Aike’ is the Tehuelche word meaning ‘Place of’.

Nibepo Aike has a total of 10 rooms, of which 8 are standard and 2 are superior. These can be set up as twin, double or triple rooms.

The estancia offers a full board experience, which in Argentina means 4 meals per day: breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. You won't go hungry!

The cuisine features typical Patagonian food, which includes stews, casseroles, meats and pastas.

Some of the activities guests can enjoy during the estancia stay include horseback rides ranging from 1 to 3 hours, guided tours, rural work demonstrations, hiking trails, and the use of bicycles.

While guests can opt for a classic stay at the estancia, there are also some more adventurous itineraries. These include overnight horse treks to visit hidden glaciers, which involve camping at outposts along the way. 

Note: This estancia welcomes day visitors for a Día de Campo, which includes a tour of the estancia, a sheep shearing demonstration, optional horse riding, and an Argentine BBQ. You can read more about our day trip to Estancia Nibepo Aike here.

""Beautiful property, very isolated and nestled among magnificent mountains and hills with access to a couple lakes. The guests house was very cute and rustic with a common fireplace and dining room, but very comfortable. The staff were friendly and accommodating. It was chilly at night so bring warm clothing (we were there in April - their autumn). When you wake up in the morning and go outside, you can hear the quiet, it is so peaceful; and if you go outside at night you can see incredible stars (hopefully it’s not cloudy!). Nice food and amazing activities too. We did a lot of horseback riding to beautiful places and the estancia tour was very interesting."" - Claire from USA

4. Helsingfors Lodge

Helsingfors Lodge is another remote estancia set within the boundaries of Los Glaciares National Park, halfway between El Calafate and El Chalten. It sits on the shores of Lago Viedma, a lake formed from melting glacial ice.

The estancia was started by Alfred Ranström, a Finnish immigrant who settled here in the early 20th century and named the place after his homeland's capital city: Helsingfors is Helsinki in Swedish. 

Helsingfors Lodge offers a boutique experience with a total of 9 rooms, each with their own private bathroom - some featuring whirlpool baths and others featuring Scottish showers.

Staying at Helsingfors Lodge also offers the opportunity to disconnect from it all. There are no televisions in the rooms, there is no mobile signal on the property, and WiFi access is only available in the lobby area. But who needs any of that to pass the time when you have untamed nature at your doorstep?

As far as activities go, your stay at this estancia is all about enjoying nature and the outdoors. That means horse trekking and hiking to places like the Blue Lagoon, Mirador del Condor, Laguna del Morro, and neighbouring Estancia Los Hermanos.

After such active days outdoors, you'll no doubt be hungry! The estancia's restaurant focuses on regional Patagonian cuisine featuring typical dishes like trout and lamb, not to mention the outdoor barbecues locally known as asado, which are prepared by the chef.

Like with most remote estancias in El Calafate, this is a seasonal property which is open from November through April. 

""If you are thinking of booking Hosteria Helsingfors, DO IT!!!!!!!! We had THE most incredible stay here. It is expensive but considering how remote it is and that all food and excursions (and transfers if you arrive/ leave on the correct day)are included, actually very fair. It is in the most incredibly beautiful, remote surroundings. The hotel is warm and cozy. We arrived in the rain and spent a wonderful first afternoon sitting by the fire. Our next two days consisted of amazing walks led by Justina - a fabulous guide. The food was some of the best we had in Argentina and beds some of the most comfortable we have stayed in. We got engaged here and the staff opened a bottle of champagne in our honour - really unexpected and kind. We just wished we had stayed longer. I would definitely recommend arranging dates so you are picked up/ Dropped back on the days the hotel offer or that you hire a car. If you do, make sure it is 4wd as the roads are hairy!! Probably the best hotel we stayed at!!!"" - Rosie from United Kingdom

El Galpón del Glacier is a guesthouse located some 20 kilometres west of El Calafate on the shores of Lago Argentino. It was formerly known as Estancia Alice, a working ranch focused on wool production, dating back to 1912.

Today, this country guesthouse welcomes guests from around the world. It has 16 rooms (double and triple) offering views of Lago Argentino and the Andes Mountain Range.

While most estancias in El Calafate are quite remote, this particular guesthouse is just a 20-minute drive from town, meaning you can enjoy the many things to do in El Calafate but also get the relaxing estancia experience.

Guests at El Galpón del Glaciar can enjoy birdwatching at Laguna de los Pájaros, a nature reserve that receives over 30 species of birds.

Horseback riding is another way to soak in the wild, rugged scenery and the staff can help organize rides based on your level of riding experience. 

In addition, the estancia offers sheep herding demonstrations with working Kelpie dogs who are true professionals at their task. They also do shearing demonstrations in the shed where you can learn more about the history of wool production in Patagonia.

El Galpón del Glaciar is a seasonal estancia that is open from October to April.

Estancias in El Calafate: What to Know

Most estancias are outside El Calafate.

Since most El Calafate estancias are current or former working ranches, they are mostly located outside of town. 

This means you should be prepared for a long journey down dirt roads. I mean, reaching certain estancias even involves a boat ride! 

This is something to think about when considering where to stay in El Calafate, since the estancia experience tends to be remote, though the reward is that you can be surrounded by raw, rugged nature.

Some estancias are inside the national park. 

Because most estancias in El Calafate predate the formation of Los Glaciares National Park, today, some of the historic estancias are located within the park boundaries. 

What this means for the estancia owners is that the property can only be inherited but not sold, and once there are no heirs the land reverts to the National Park Service. 

For you the guest, it simply means you are privy to unspoiled nature! 

Staying at an estancia can be pricey.

There's no denying it, staying at an estancia comes with a certain price tag, especially if you're opting for the luxury estancias. 

So why are estancias so expensive? 

First, you have to consider their remote location; the long distances mean that everything has to be brought in and staff need to be housed on-site! 

Also, keep in mind that the cost of your stay often includes the transfer from El Calafate to the estancia, full room and board, and guided activities to keep you entertained for the duration of your stay. 

Estancia stays are a great way to disconnect. 

As you've been reading through these estancia descriptions trying to choose which one is right for you, you may have noticed that many force you to disconnect simply because of their geographic location! 

That's right. Some estancias have no WiFi connection, no mobile signal, and no TVs in the room! 

The focus is on admiring the panoramic views, enjoying outdoor activities and connecting with fellow guests.

A few estancias welcome day visitors. 

An overnight stay is the best way to get the full estancia experience, however, if your budget doesn't quite extend that far, some estancias near El Calafate let you visit for the day.

You'll typically see these day trips advertised as a Día de Campo which translates to a 'Countryside Day'. 

The itinerary usually includes a guided visit of the estancia, a sheep shearing demonstration (if it happens to be a working sheep ranch), perhaps a hike or a horse trek, and the visit generally ends with a traditional Argentine BBQ. 

Stay at an estancia at the end of your trip.

I know I keep repeating myself, telling you that most of these estancias are very remote, but that brings me to my next piece of advice: save your estancia stay for the end of your visit!

There are so many things to do in El Calafate, not to mention all the excursions to see the glaciers, and it's better to be centrally located to make the most of these activities and travel places.

So stay in El Calafate for a few days, and then tack on at least 2 days at an estancia as a way to unwind. You won't want to leave the estancia once you get there, so it's the best way to end your trip to Patagonia!

And if you can't get enough of the estancia experience, consider doing another estancia stay in Cordoba's Sierras or an estancia stay in Buenos Aires just before flying back home - there are lots of beautiful properties quite close to the airport!

Lastly, consider glamping in Patagonia. 

This blog post has been strictly focused on estancias in El Calafate, however, if you're looking for unique accommodations, you can also consider glamping.

There are plenty of luxury domes near El Calafate and El Chalten, which also make for a memorable experience. 

Or you can consider glamping just outside Buenos Aires at the end of your trip.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,bd6fc3e842985ca984a0db0abf0db547f2f5e349
2d1f12f403b62bdb3e00a775ade1513a45325e13,che_argentina_travel,en,Gaiman: Visiting a Welsh Town in Patagonia & Where to Find Afternoon Tea!,"Did you know you can visit a Welsh town in Patagonia?

Set along the shores of the Chubut River in the Province of Chubut, you’ll find the town of Gaiman.

The town was founded by David D. Roberts in 1874 and like much of the Lower Chubut Valley, it was settled by Welsh immigrants.

Y Wladfa refers to the establishment of settlements by Welsh immigrants in Patagonia, however, in many ways, Gaiman is considered the heart of the Welsh colony in Patagonia.

Yes, you have the communities of Rawson, Trelew, Dolavon, Las Plumas, Paso de Indios and Trevelin as you cross the province from the Atlantic to the Andes. However, nowhere is Welsh culture better preserved than in Gaiman!

In fact, to this day, Gaiman celebrates the Eisteddfod, a Welsh festival where locals compete in poetry, music, dance, drama and art - in both Welsh and Spanish.

In this blog post, we're going to talk about the history of Welsh immigration to Argentina, plus we'll share some things to do in Gaiman, and info on where to find Welsh afternoon tea during your visit.

If you're planning to travel coastal Patagonia, this is one destination you won't want to miss!

History of a Welsh Town in Patagonia

So, how did Patagonia become home to a thriving Welsh community?

The Welsh settlement in Argentina is a unique and interesting chapter in history, beginning in the 19th century. The primary motivation for Welsh people to emigrate to Argentina was to preserve their language and culture, amidst fears that these were being eroded under English influence in Wales.

The idea of a Welsh colony in Patagonia was put forward by Michael D. Jones, a Welsh nationalist non-conformist preacher. He envisioned the creation of a Welsh utopia and called for a ""Little Wales beyond Wales"".

Lewis Jones was instrumental in organizing the migration and was one of the key figures in negotiating terms with the Argentine government. He played a significant role in choosing Patagonia as the destination for the Welsh settlement.

Towards the end of 1862, Lewis Jones (who Trelew is named after) and Captain Love Jones-Parry left for Patagonia to see if it was a suitable area for Welsh emigrants. They arrived in Buenos Aires where they held discussions with the Interior Minister Guillermo Rawson and having come to an agreement they continued south to Patagonia. On their return to Wales, they announced the area to be very suitable for colonization.

And that is how in 1865, a ship known as the Mimosa landed on Patagonia's shores (in what is now known as Puerto Madryn) carrying the first Welsh emigrants to South America.

It was July 28, so the middle of winter in Argentina, and the new arrivals found themselves in a climate that was completely different from what they'd known back home. Gone were the lush green fields of Wales; here they were met with the arid landscapes of the Patagonian steppe.

What would cause people to cross an ocean and start a new life somewhere so unknown?

At the time, the Welsh were experiencing persecution under the British Empire. Their language, culture, religion and way of life were being threatened, and as life grew more difficult, the idea of forming a Wales beyond Wales began to take form.

The first Welsh settlements formed along the coast, first in caves, and then slowly moved inland into the valley. The Welsh survived those early years thanks to the help of the Tehuelche people who taught them how to hunt and endure in this new climate.

Over time, the Welsh settlers moved westwards across the Province of Chubut, settling the valley along the Lower Chubut River and venturing as far as Esquel and Trevelin at the foot of the Andes Mountains.

John Daniel Evans was another notable figure who arrived in Argentina in the early years of the settlement. He is best known for his exploration and development efforts in the region and he was a central figure in mapping areas and expanding the territory of the Welsh settlement.

And that's why today there are so many Welsh towns in Patagonia. This is just a very brief overview of Welsh immigration to Argentina, but I would recommend this article if you're interested in the history of Welsh Patagonia.

How to get to Gaiman

The easiest way to visit Gaiman is by renting a car and driving into town at your leisure. It’s a 15-minute drive from Trelew, or a 1-hour ride if you’re coming from Puerto Madryn.

Alternatively, you can catch a bus from the Trelew Bus Terminal. There are two possible routes, one that takes the highway and another that takes a parallel country road. Either way, you can expect the journey to Gaiman to take anywhere between 20-45 minutes, depending on the route and the number of stops the bus makes!

From Puerto Madryn, the bus takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

If you'd rather join a guided tour to Gaiman that's another option. This Welsh colonies tour departs from Puerto Madryn and includes a stop in Trelew.

Welsh Tea Houses in Gaiman

The main thing to do in Gaiman is to visit one of the town's many tea houses for Welsh afternoon tea. My suggestion is to skip lunch and go hungry because there will be a lot of food!

List of tea houses in Gaiman:

Ty Te Caerdydd

Ty Gwyn

Plas y Coed

Te House Gaiman

Ty Cymraeg

Casa de Té Nain Glenys

The most famous tea house is Ty Te Caerdydd as it hosted Lady Diana during her visit to Argentina in 1995. That being said, you can expect a similar menu at all these tea houses, including Bara brith known as torta galesa in Spanish or 'Welsh cake' in Patagonia.

Things to do in Gaiman

There are lots of things to do in Gaiman, ranging from visiting orchards and tea houses to historic homes and museums! In fact, if you want to learn more about the history of this Welsh town in Patagonia, you won't want to miss the numerous museums sprinkled across town.

Quintas Narlú

My favourite place to visit in Gaiman was actually on the outskirts of town, so I’ll start there.

Quintas Narlú is a beautiful farm that welcomes visitors. We first walked into their shop, which features all sorts of homemade jams, freshly picked berries, Welsh Bara brith cake, honey, dry lavender bundles, plus all sorts of Argentine souvenirs.

We purchased some cake and berries and then the owner told us we could also have a look around the farm, so we ended up having a picnic in the apple orchard.

It’s a beautiful spot where you’re surrounded by nature. Well worth the visit if you’re spending the day in Gaiman!

Central Chubut Railway Tunnel

One of Gaiman’s main tourist attractions is the old train tunnel that was part of the Central Chubut Railway. The railway operated between the valley of the Chubut River and the port city of Puerto Madryn. It was in operation from 1888 (making it the first railway in Patagonia!) to 1961. It also helped cut down travel time since this journey was previously something that had to be done on horseback.

The train tunnel was built to extend the train tracks from Gaiman to Dolavon while bypassing the centre of town.

The curved tunnel is 282 metres in length and it is one of the last remnants of the railway. Inside the tunnel, you’ll find audiovisual displays that share the history of the railway in Spanish, English and Welsh.

I’m going to be honest, as a woman, I probably wouldn’t venture into this tunnel on my own. It’s one way in and the same way out, and it’s not well illuminated at all - there were sections where I had to use the flashlight on my phone to see where I was even stepping. Because the tunnel is curved, you also can’t see what’s at the end or if there’s anyone there, so maybe go in with another person or a group.

Regional History Museum

Another place to visit in Gaiman for those wanting to learn a little bit more about the town’s origins is the Regional History Museum, also known as the Museo Histórico Regional de Gaiman. Just be sure to check the schedule before visiting since at the time of writing this, the museum only opens one day a week!

The Regional History Museum is set in the former train station and it displays a variety of items that were brought over by the early Welsh settlers.

There are rooms with furniture and crockery, others with farming equipment, and another section that focuses on the Eisteddfod - a Welsh cultural festival with a strong focus on singing, reciting poetry and dancing.

Gaiman holds the Eisteddfod in September and the competitions are in both Spanish and Welsh.

Tehuelche-Mapuche Museum

The Tehuelche-Mapuche Museum, formerly known as the Gaiman Anthropological Museum, is set in one of the first two-story buildings in Gaiman, which dates back to 1910.

This is a great museum to visit to gain a better understanding of the original peoples (the Tehuelches and the Mapuches) who lived in this area prior to the arrival of the Spanish and later the Welsh.

The museum also looks at the friendship that emerged between the Tehuelches and the Welsh, and how they helped the newcomers survive in a new and hostile climate that was very different to the one they'd left behind.

Guided tours are done in Spanish, so it does help to know the language in order to get the most out of the visit!

First House in Gaiman

Additionally, you can tour the first house to be built in Gaiman by the Welsh settlers.

This first house was built of stone in 1874. In it lived David D. Roberts and his wife Jemima Jones, who became the first settlers of Gaiman.

The house would’ve originally had a reed and mud roof, though today there’s a metal one.

Inside you can see some of the furnishings and special items this couple would have brought over from Wales, and you can also get an idea of what life would’ve been like in the early days of this rural Patagonian community.

Visiting this house is done as a guided tour. The young gentleman who gave us our tour spoke Spanish, English and was also studying Welsh.

Gaiman Panoramic Point

If you’re up for a fairly short and easy hike, you can head up to the Gaiman Panoramic Point. There’s a sculpture up top called The Shape of Silence, plus you get panoramic views of this little Welsh town in Patagonia.

Is Welsh still spoken in Patagonia?

Having travelled extensively across the Welsh-founded communities of Patagonia, I can truthfully say there isn't a significant population of Welsh speakers.

The first few generations of Welsh descendants kept the language alive, however, today the number of fluent Welsh speakers is quite small. This is understandable since the Welsh descendants live in a Spanish-speaking country and they've assimilated since their ancestors arrived in Argentina several generations back!

I met a few Welsh descendants who told me they had studied Welsh as a second language in school, but their knowledge was either basic or they only remembered some vocabulary.

That being said, there is a Welsh Language Project (WLP) that promotes the Welsh language in the Chubut region of Patagonia. They send Welsh teachers to Argentina to help develop the language in Welsh-speaking communities via formal teaching as well as informal social activities. So there is an effort underway to help keep Patagonian Welsh alive!

Where to eat in Gaiman

If you’re planning to spend the whole day in Gaiman, or if you’re planning to stay for a few days, you’ll want more than just afternoon tea! Here are a few restaurants to consider across town:

Gwalia Lân Resto - This cosy restaurant serves a mix of homemade pasta and Welsh-inspired dishes.

Na Petko - This restaurant serves up classic Argentine fare in a tranquil setting next to the river.

Cactus Cervecería - This spot serves up beer, pizzas and snack platters you can share with friends.

Where to stay in Gaiman

Gaiman is a small town and since most people visit on a day trip, accommodations are few and far between. That being said, there are a few guesthouses for those wanting to spend the night in this Welsh town in Patagonia.

Posada los Mimbres - This is a 3-star hotel located 4 km from the historic district. It offers beautiful gardens, a swimming pool, free bicycles to get around, and a restaurant that serves home-cooked meals.

Hostería Gwesty Plas y Coed - This place offers private rooms in a Welsh-style house in the historic centre of Gaiman.

Alternatively, you can look for accommodations in nearby Trelew. The two communities are 17 kilometres apart, so if you'd rather stay in a city with a few more options, that's something to consider.

That's our guide to visiting Gaiman, a charming Welsh town in Patagonia, Argentina!

If you're already going to be travelling in this part of the Province of Chubut, this town is certainly worth a visit.

Hopefully, this blog post has given you a few ideas of things to do in Gaiman and now, you should have no trouble finding a tea house where to enjoy Welsh afternoon tea!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,e9f0f4633d719c5865175546970020b2e856d416

1. Chalten Camp

There is no Patagonian glamping camp more famous than Chalten Camp! This is a bucket list property that travellers tack on as a fun reward after trekking through Los Glaciares National Park, because who doesn't want to unwind with epic views of Mount Fitz Roy?

Chalten Camp offers luxury glamping in El Chalten with 12 domes; these are divided into 4 deluxe domes with forest views and 8 premium domes that look out to Fitz Roy.

The domes are insulated and equipped with wood-burning stoves for a comfortable stay. They can be set up as doubles or triples, and they also have their own private bathroom.

The camp has a larger main dome that acts as a communal space to meet up with other travellers, and it serves as a dining room during meal times.

But I would say the beauty of this camp is found in all the outdoor spaces where you can pause and enjoy the scenery; there are picnic tables, hammocks and even a firepit where you can take a moment to appreciate the natural splendour around you.

""We had the best time here!! The staff was so friendly and accommodating! The food was out of this world delicious! The area was so beautiful to explore and close to hiking trails. The staff made a fire for us every night and put hot water bottles to heat our bed. We had a beautiful time in our clean, cozy, stylish room enjoying a view of Fitz Roy and the beautiful surroundings. Thank you so much Camp Chalten!!!! P.S. They gave us champagne for our anniversary! Such a nice little surprise!!"" - Emily from USA

2. Ovo Patagonia

When it comes to glamping in El Chalten, you cannot overlook Ovo Patagonia - this brand-new property is as unique as it gets!

Ovo Patagonia consists of four transparent capsules that are mounted on a rock wall 270 meters above the valley. This makes reaching the capsules an adventure in and of itself, as you have to hike through native forest and then tackle a Via Ferrata. But the rewards are the panoramic views of Mount Fitz Roy and the Andes Mountains! 

This glamping stay is geared towards more adventurous travellers. You'll need to be in good physical condition for the hiking and via ferrata, and you'll also have to be okay with heights! All guests must be over 16 years old.

Each capsule can hold 2 guests and is divided into three floors: there is a bedroom on the top level, a lounge and bathroom with a vanity and dry toilet in the middle, and netting for hanging out on the bottom level.

What's special about this El Chalten glamping experience is that you can visit for the day or spend the night: Ovo Night includes dinner and breakfast, while Ovo Half-Day includes lunch.

""Loved my stay at Ovo. I have always wanted to stay in 1 of these capsules & it didn't disappoint. The views were amazing. I was very lucky to have a sunset, sunrise & clear night full of stars. The staff are so helpful & friendly. The bed was super comfortable."" - Cathy from UK

3. Patagonia Eco Domes

Another popular choice for glamping domes in El Chalten is Patagonia Eco Domes. This property is located a half-hour drive north of El Chalten and has 9 geodomes. 

I would describe this as the mid-range option on this list - it's not luxury glamping, but it's not camping either! They describe themselves as 'luxury ecological domes' but keep in mind that this is more of an off-grid option with no cellphone reception, no internet service and no 220-volt electricity. The energy supply in each dome is 12 volts for charging via USB plugs. I would say they offer an eco-friendly glamping experience in El Chalten.

Guests can choose between regular domes and deluxe domes. All of the domes have their own private bathroom; the only difference is that the deluxe rooms are slightly larger and also have extra heating in the bathroom. 

One of the main draws to Patagonia Eco Domes is the easy accessibility to many of El Chalten's most epic trails. You can find the trailhead to Laguna de los Tres right from the domes, which helps cut down the otherwise lengthy journey.

Plus, you have the Rio Blanco just 500 metres away, and the Piedras Blancas Glacier is 1 hour and 40 minutes away.

Accommodations are inclusive of breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

If you're staying two nights or more, the property will also arrange a free private transfer from El Chalten to the glamping site and back.

""Our stay in Eco Domes was just perfect, can't recommend this property enough!. We went there for our last destination in our honeymoon with the objective to relax and enjoy, and Eco Domes really exceed the expectations. (1) Staff was AMAZING! They were all incredible accommodating and welcoming even before we got to the property. They helped coordinate transportations and guide us on best ways to do ""Laguna de los 3"" hike. (2) Location was perfect to disconnect and enjoy nature. They property is ~1 mile from ""Sendero Pilar"" which leads to the Fitz Roy, so we were able to do a different hike with less people for most part, being able to enjoy the trip. (3) Food OMG it was top notch, the menu and the quality of the food was incredible. Really good options for dinner and great variety for breakfast. The domes itself are beautiful and have a direct view to the Fitz Roy which was the cherry on the top. We stayed for 2 night which gave us enough time to be able to enjoy the property."" - Magdalena from Mexico

4. Fitz Camp Glamping Agreste

Fitz Camp Glamping Agreste is located at the base of Mount Fitz Roy, and it's a renovated camping facility frequented by hikers who want to break up the trek to Mount Fitz Roy and wake up to an incredible sunrise. 

Now, while this property calls itself 'glamping agreste' or 'wild glamping', I want to make it very clear that it's actually a camping experience! You will be sleeping in tents and only the breakfast area is set in a geodesic dome.

When you book their 'small twin room', you are actually booking a camping tent for two, which is already set up for you with two sleeping bags and 2 pillows. One of the upsides is that you don't have to carry all your camping gear with you.

While the price is a bit high, you are camping in El Chalten, so it's all about the location and the views you wake up to. Rates are full board and include dinner and breakfast.

So if you're looking to do a bit of camping in Argentina, this is a pretty epic destination to do so. 

""Excellent location- it was so great to explore the mountains and not have to carry too much food and gear! The staff were very knowledgeable about the hiking routes and gave us great advice. The camp is comfortable and has everything you need. Would recommend."" - Christina from South Africa

1. Chalten Camp, El Chalten

High-end domes in Argentina's trekking capital

Chalten Camp is one of the most iconic glamping experiences in Patagonia offering geodesic domes in the middle of the forest just outside the town of El Chalten. 

The property has a total of 12 domes: 8 of these are premium domes with views of Mount Fitz Roy and the other 4 are deluxe domes with forest views. These include a mixture of double and triple domes.

All of the domes sit on raised platforms, offer 220-volt electricity, are insulated, and have a wooden stove (lit by staff members daily at sunset!) for a comfortable stay. 

Each dome houses one bedroom and a private bathroom with a walk-in shower, slippers and free toiletries.

Guests also have access to the main dome, which serves as a living room and dining room and acts as a communal gathering space.

The idea when you come to El Chaltén is to disconnect and be at one with nature, however, WiFi is available in the main dome. This is the only spot on the camp that offers connectivity, however, it's worth noting that the internet in El Chaltén can be quite intermittent regardless of where you stay. But again, you're here to hike and marvel at the beauty of the surrounding mountain peaks!

Chalten Camp also has several outdoor areas to enjoy. There's an outdoor fire pit which is a fun spot in the evenings to swap stories over a glass of wine or even do a bit of stargazing if you have clear skies. 

There are outdoor picnic tables for those who want to enjoy a meal al fresco while exploring the Río de Las Vueltas valley. 

Plus, there are lots of hammocks scattered around (some with views of Mount Fitz Roy!) which make for a perfect afternoon siesta out in nature.

The days at Chalten Camp end with a candlelit dinner. Their restaurant specializes in traditional Argentinian cuisine and also features vegetarian, vegan and dairy-free food options. Just let the staff know of your needs in advance.

This is a luxury glamping experience in Patagonia with a price tag to match, however, if you're looking to splurge, it's not a bad way to end your stay in El Chalten.

We had the best time here!! The staff was so friendly and accommodating! The food was out of this world delicious! The area was so beautiful to explore and close to hiking trails.

2. Patagonia Eco Domes, El Chalten

Remote eco-camp near trailheads

Patagonia Eco Domes offers a more remote glamping experience in El Chalten for anyone looking to combine a memorable stay with some trekking.

The glamping site is located 16 kilometres or a 30-minute drive north of El Chalten, so you'll either need to rent a vehicle or arrange for a private transfer (Patagonia Eco Domes offers a free shuttle to and from El Chalten when you book 2 or more nights).

There are a total of 9 domes at Patagonia Eco Domes which include both double and triple domes. These are equipped with a private bathroom, wood stove, and all of them offer views (either full or partial) of Mount Fitz Roy! 

There are two larger domes that act as bases in the middle of the camp. These include a dome that serves as a restaurant and a dome that acts as a reception and communal hangout space.

This eco-camp is a bit more off-grid. For starters, there is no 220-volt electricity, however, each dome has its own energy supply via solar panels which is 12 volts. They have USB plugs for charging.

This is the type of place where you really come to disconnect as there is no cellphone reception and no internet service on site. So maybe bring some books to read or just enjoy the tranquillity of it all!

Another advantage of staying at Patagonia Eco Domes is that this glamping site offers private access to Laguna de los Tres hiking trail. This is one of the best-known and most epic hikes you can do in El Chalten, though you've been warned, it's a challenging one with the final kilometre (the ascent!) being the most gruelling.

The treks to Rio Blanco and Glaciar Piedras Blancas can also be easily accessed from this camp.

""We cannot recommend the eco domes enough. We are a couple from LA and have traveled all over the world and can confidently say this is one of the best places we have ever stayed. The domes are glamping chic and comfortable (the bed is to die for), the water runs hot, the food is truly fantastic and better than most of the food in LA, the staff are kind, welcoming, and knowledgeable. It is simple to arrange transportation anywhere you need, and the pickup from the bus is smooth. The breakfasts were eggs, bacon, and huge array of yogurt fruit and pastries. Packed lunches were solid with sandwiches plus empanadas and fruit. The chef who makes the dinners is extremely talented. Get the pork if on menu. It will haunt me in my dreams. The wine selection is superb. There is no WiFi but that’s fine, just download books etc prior if wanted. Don’t hesitate - this place is special."" - Logan from USA

Luxury domes with lake and glacier views

Pristine Luxury Camps is a small boutique chain that offers luxury camping across Argentina. Their current roster features 3 properties in Salinas Grandes, Jujuy; Iguazú, Misiones; and most recently, El Calafate, Santa Cruz. We're focusing on the latter.

The domes offer king-sized or twin beds, a sofabed which can be made into a bed for a third guest, a wood-burning stove, a minibar and a full bathroom. The maximum capacity is 3 guests per dome.

Each dome has its own deck with an outdoor hot tub that boasts panoramic views of the Perito Moreno Glacier. 

In terms of experiences at Pristine El Calafate Luxury Camp, guests can book a variety of activities like guided treks, horseback riding, and mountain biking excursions.

This is one of the more unique accommodations in El Calafate, if you don't mind the remote location. 

""We went with a friend and we had a great time, a beautiful place. The location of Pristine Camps is simply spectacular, it leaves you speechless. The domes are comfortable and have everything you need to have a great time without losing the vibe of being in the middle of nature. The best of all were the activities.

In short, if you want to live an unforgettable adventure in El Calafate, Pristine Camps is the ideal place. We are already planning to return!"" - Laura from Argentina

4. Nomade Glamping y Domos, Trevelin

Secluded domes close to the Chilean border

Nomade Glamping y Domos is a glamping site that's located in Los Cipreses, about 25 kilometres from the Patagonian-Welsh town of Trevelin. The property sits on the shores of the Futaleufú River and is quite close to the Chilean border. 

These Patagonian glamping domes are geared to travellers looking for a self-catered vacation. The domes have a wood-burning stove, mini fridge, outdoor grill, cooking utensils, and plates and cutlery for two. 

Each dome has its own private bathroom, hot water and electricity 24 hours per day.

As far as activities go for guests at Nomade Glamping y Domos, you can go on guided horse treks through the Baggilt Lake Protected Natural Area, shop artisanal products at Casa de la Artesanía, trek through the surrounding Patagonian forests, and visit the Casa Yagüe Winery. (We visited this winery on a day trip and it was one of the highlights of our time in Trevelin!)

While many glamping sites in Patagonia are luxury experiences with matching price tags, Nomade Glamping y Domos is a budget-friendly alternative in a beautiful corner of Patagonia. You just have to be willing to go off the beaten path!

""Beautiful domes in the middle of the mountains. Worth the drive from Trevelin. Daniel and Joaquin who welcomed us (and built the domes) were absolutely lovely. Warm inside the dome and so beautiful. Everything you need inside, hot showers stove and drinking water."" - Jeromine from Australia

Forest domes in a massive mountain reserve

Huemules is a mountain reserve made up of 6,200 hectares of land situated just 23 kilometres from Esquel.

When it comes to accommodations, guests have a few different options to choose from. This property first started out offering dome stays, however, they have since also expanded to tiny houses. The domes can fit 2 guests in a queen or twin layout, while the tiny houses can hold up to 4 guests.

All of the accommodations feature a private en suite bathroom, a wood-burning stove, 220-volt electricity, a private deck, and either forest or mountain views.

Huemules offers a full room and board experience which includes 4 meals per day: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. There is a strong focus on regional Patagonian dishes using local and seasonal ingredients.

During the summer months, visitors can enjoy activities like horseback riding, mountain biking and trekking. Meanwhile, during the winter months, there is snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, as well as horseback riding through the snowy forest. 

Huemules Mountain Reserve is also a great spot to view wildlife, which around these parts includes woodpeckers, wild geese, condors, foxes and deer! 

""Huemules is a beautiful place with even more beautiful people. The staff is truly amazing, making expeditions special, fun and unique. Between mountain biking, trekking, and horseback treks, you can explore 23 square miles of this oasis with one of a kind guides.

7. Eco Domos Lago Verde, Los Alerces NP

Lakeside camping domes in a national park

Eco Domos Lago Verde is a camping experience set on the shores of a lake in Los Alerces National Park outside of Esquel. However, in comparison to some of the other glamping domes on this list, this place is a bit more rugged and off-grid.

These eco domes are set in a seasonal campsite that's only open during the summer months from mid-December to mid-March, weather-dependent. 

Two sizes of domes are available: the smaller domes are for 2 guests while the larger domes can fit up to 4 guests. 

Guests are required to either bring their own sleeping bag or bedding, or this can be rented at the campsite upon arrival. 

There is no electricity inside the domes, however, there is lighting to illuminate the communal areas between 8:00 pm and midnight. 

Similarly, there is no phone signal in the area, though you can pay for access to satellite internet should you need it. 

There are no bathrooms inside the domes, but rather communal bathrooms similar to what you would find in a campsite setting. 

This experience is more geared towards adventurous travellers who are okay with a little less glamping and a little more camping!

There are lots of fun experiences to be had in Los Alerces National Park, plus you can explore the nearby town of Esquel and even ride the famed train known as the Old Patagonian Express.

""Excellent experience, three incredible nights. The people who work there are super friendly, the place is incredible and the Very good domes. They were cleaned every day, very clean. The restaurant of the complex 10 points, we ate a delicious trout."" - Estefania from Argentina

8. Eiwa Domos, El Bolson

Mountain-view domes in a hippie town

Eiwa Domos is a small glamping complex featuring 2 domes located in the mountain town of El Bolson.

The complex sits in a residential neighbourhood about 2.2 kilometres from the centre of town, so staying here does require a vehicle for greater comfort. 

As for the setting, while you're not out in nature, you do get nice views of Cerro Piltriquitrón.

Domo Cielo or Sky Dome can hold 4 guests. The main floor has a kitchen and dining area as well as a bedroom with 2 single beds. There is a second bedroom upstairs with a double bed and a skylight for stargazing. 

Similarly, Domo Tierra or Earth Dome, can also hold 4 guests. There is a double bed upstairs and another sofa bed in the living room. 

The kitchens in the domes are equipped with a fridge, electric oven, kettle, microwaves, and cooking utensils. There is heating and there is WiFi!

This can be a nice base not only for exploring El Bolson but also Lago Puelo and the small communities that make up La Comarca Andina.

""A very quiet, cozy place. With a large front patio and a beautiful view. It doesn't have television. A distance of 20-30 minutes walking to the central square. The attention of the owner is very good."" - Micaela from Argentina

9. Domo La Galaxia, Bariloche

Remote lakeside dome for stargazing

Domo La Galaxia or Galaxy Dome is a vacation home rental on the outskirts of Bariloche. It sits on the shores of Lago Nahuel Huapi and it's the ideal place for travellers who are looking to disconnect. 

This is a two-story construction featuring a cube-like space on the ground level with a small kitchen, living/dining area and bathroom. 

A set of stairs leads guests up to the second floor where you'll find the transparent dome that holds the bedroom and offers panoramic views in all directions.

If you want to end your days in Patagonia listening to the lapping waves and gazing at the starry night sky, this is the place for you!

Again, this is a simpler and more budget-friendly dome experience on the outskirts of the city, but the idea is to come and enjoy the surrounding beauty of nature and the outdoors.

You can use your time in Bariloche to visit Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest on a day trip, tackle some of the treks in and around town, or join one of the many history-filled walking tours. You can get a better idea of some of the different available excursions from Bariloche here.

""Beautiful experience, you sleep looking at the stars and listening to the lake, it is even more beautiful than in photos.

Each dome has its own private bathroom with a walk-in shower and an eight-jet jacuzzi. Plus, the bathroom has panoramic windows that offer views of the lake, mountains and the starry sky of Villa Traful.

The domes also have a kitchenette with a refrigerator, electric range, crockery and kitchen items. 

The private deck is great for unwinding at the end of the day and soaking in those views after a busy day of trekking, hiking, horseback riding, fishing or lakeside adventures.

Patagonia Glamping Tips and Tricks

There are glamping domes to suit all budgets.

As you have seen with this list, the price range for glamping in Patagonia is varied. You can find everything from mountainside luxury domes that offer full room and board to simpler lakeside domes more akin to camping. 

Keep in mind that the less touristy destinations have more affordable domes.

Splurge at the end of your trip.

If you are looking to book one of the luxury glamping domes in places like El Calafate or El Chalten, I would recommend doing so towards the end of your stay. 

You're probably going to have an action-packed itinerary featuring plenty of trekking, so this is a nice way to end things off. 

Don't plan too much during your glamping stay so you can make the most of your time on site.

Some glamping sites in Patagonia are seasonal.

While you can travel Patagonia year-round, some of the glamping domes on this list are only open for part of the year considering the extreme weather in this remote part of Argentina. 

If you really want to stay at a particular glamping site, double-check your dates. The winter months in the southern hemisphere are June-September and many businesses close for 3 to 4 months.

Pack for cooler weather.

Since we're focusing exclusively on glamping in Patagonia, it's important you pack warm layers. This is essential if you're visiting outside the summer season and you're heading to some of the more southern destinations. 

The domes in cooler destinations have wood-burning stoves, but you'll also want to dress accordingly.

Glamping versus estancias.

If you enjoy glamping, you may also want to treat yourself to an estancia stay or two as these are a quintessential aspect of travel in Patagonia. There's nothing quite like staying at a working ranch and getting to see a different side of rural life in Argentina. 

Also, don't forget that there are plenty of estancias and glamping sites close to Buenos Aires, so you can get your fill just before you fly out of the country! 

And if you're heading to Mendoza, then wine hotels are the accommodation of choice there for a truly immersive experience.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,07a2a2b037e6a7fc75cbf242eab8e775933259da

Well, we've got you covered with all the information you'll need.

El Calafate and El Chalten are two towns that are often visited in tandem. El Calafate is the gateway to the southern end of Los Glaciares National Park and the famous Perito Moreno Glacier, while El Chaltén is a trekker's paradise with jagged mountain peaks, turquoise lakes, and winding glacial rivers in the northern end of Los Glaciares National Park. These are two of the most beautiful destinations in Patagonia!

In this transportation guide, we'll share the different ways of getting to El Chalten, first flying into El Calafate as it's the closest destination with an airport, and then using ground transportation to reach this remote mountain town situated in Los Glaciares National Park.

Getting from El Calafate to El Chalten

The distance from El Calafate to El Chaltén in Argentina is 210 kilometres or 130 miles. This route offers a beautiful journey with scenic views of Patagonian landscapes, including lakes, mountains, and steppes.

Flying into El Calafate

First things first, in order to reach El Chalten, you first need to fly into El Calafate.

El Chalten does not have an airport, so the only way to get there is by flying into Aeropuerto Internacional Comandante Armando Tola de El Calafate and then taking a bus, private transfer, taxi or driving your own rental car.

El Calafate receives flights from:

Buenos Aires to El Calafate - 3 hours 15 minutes

Bariloche to El Calafate - 1 hour 45 minutes

Ushuaia to El Calafate - 1 hour 20 minutes

Bus from El Calafate to El Chalten

The following 3 bus companies cover the route from El Calafate to El Chalten:

Cal Tur

Chalten Travel Turismo

Marga Taqsa

These 3 bus companies each offer 3-5 departures per day. 

Book your tickets to El Chalten via BusBud.

During high season, the first departure is at 8:00 am and the last departure is at 6:00 pm. I would not recommend showing up for the last bus of the day without a prior reservation as it could be sold out or cancelled if there's not enough demand.

El Calafate Bus Terminal is located on the outskirts of town on the corner of Calle 510 and Calle 814.

The bus journey from El Calafate to El Chalten takes approximately 2.5 to 3 hours one way, depending on the bus company you choose to travel with.

It takes slightly longer than driving by car since most buses make a stop at La Leona, located on National Route 40. This is a roadside rest area and country lodge where passengers can disembark, stretch their legs, use the restrooms, and buy snacks before continuing toward El Chalten.

The stop at La Leona comes 106 kilometres after leaving El Calafate or 1 hour and 18 minutes into the journey. From there, it's another 109 kilometres to El Chalten or 1 hour and 16 minutes.

No food or beverages are served on the bus from El Calafate to El Chalten, so this stop is a good opportunity to get some food, though you won't have enough time to enjoy a sit-down meal at the restaurant.

Tip: The buses from El Calafate to El Chaltén can sell out during high season (from December to February), so booking your bus tickets in advance is a good idea.

Private transfer to El Chalten

Another way to get from El Calafate to El Chalten is via private transfer. You can arrange a pickup from El Calafate Airport or from your accommodation in El Calafate.

Depending on the size of your group, the transfer can be done in an SUV or a small shuttle bus.

The following companies offer private transfers to El Chalten:

Las Lengas

Ves Patagonia

If you know your return date, you can book your transfer round trip from El Calafate to El Chalten and then El Chalten to El Calafate.

Taxi to El Chalten

You can also get a taxi to drive you from El Calafate to El Chalten, however, this is the most expensive option. 

I would only recommend this as a last resort if all the buses are fully sold out and taxis are the only thing available. 

In that case, try to get a little group together at the bus station, fill every seat in the taxi, and split the cost evenly between travellers.

Here are some local companies in El Calafate to contact: 

Taxi Remis Calafate Viajes Turísticos 

Taxi Remis Los Andes 

Taxis Remis El Puma 

Taxi Remis Condor

Renting a car in El Calafate

If you prefer to self-drive and have a vehicle for the duration of your trip, you can pick up a rental car upon landing at El Calafate Airport.

One thing to keep in mind is that the majority of cars in Argentina are standard or manual transmission, so if you can only drive automatic, you'll want to reserve a vehicle well in advance as these are few and far between. Automatic vehicles do cost more.

Even if you're okay driving a standard vehicle, you'll still want to reserve a car in advance if you're travelling during the high season, as the demand is quite high from December to February.

You can browse Discover Cars for up-to-date rates - they are a car rental comparison website with an aggregate search tool that helps you find the best car deals available.

These are the car rental companies you can find at El Calafate Airport if you'd prefer to check each website one by one.

Tips for driving from El Calafate to El Chalten

You can opt to pick up your rental car at El Calafate Airport or from an agency in the town of El Calafate. 

Car rental rates vary depending on the length of the rental agreement - the longer you rent the cheaper the day rate. 

Most cars in Argentina have manual transmissions, so if you can only drive automatic, you'll need to reserve a car well in advance.

Beware of the winds in Patagonia. You will see signs along the highway warning you of areas that are prone to strong winds. You will, on occasion, also encounter vehicles overturned by said winds. Drive according to the weather conditions, especially if you're in a light vehicle.

The road between El Calafate and El Chalten is paved and in good condition, so there is no need for a 4x4 vehicle. However, if you're venturing to more remote destinations, maybe for an overnight estancia stay or glamping adventure, then a 4-wheel drive is a good idea.

Renting a car is the best option if you want the most flexibility to move between El Calafate and El Chalten.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,97e6e03dd353f895fd0e00a939c64abb9864f773

Should you take a plane, bus, train or even attempt driving? Well, we've got you covered and we're going to let you know exactly what your options are and what to expect from each journey.

Situated on the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake, Bariloche is considered the gateway to Patagonia offering panoramic mountain views, a plethora of outdoor adventures, and a picturesque alpine-inspired downtown lined with chocolate shops, craft breweries, and restaurants. It's no wonder it's so popular with both domestic and international tourists!

Bariloche also happens to be a year-round destination (lakeside fun in the summertime, and snowy adventures in the wintertime), meaning it is very well-connected with the rest of Argentina. Whether you're spending 2 days in Bariloche or sticking around for a week, there's plenty to do here.

So let's dive right in and see what's the best way for you to get here - airplane, bus, train or car!

How to get to Bariloche

Getting to Bariloche by Plane

If you're flying to Bariloche, you'll arrive at Aeropuerto Internacional Teniente Luis Candelaria (BRC), locally known as Bariloche Airport.

Most flights to Bariloche arrive from Buenos Aires from either Aeroparque (the airport in Buenos Aires) or Ezeiza (the airport in the outskirts of Buenos Aires). There is a high flight frequency between Buenos Aires and Bariloche with multiple flights per hour including flights with the national airline and various low-cost carriers.

You can also get direct flights from a few other major Argentine cities, though frequency varies throughout the year.

Flight times to Bariloche

Buenos Aires (EZE) to Bariloche (BRC) - 2 hours 20 minutes

Buenos Aires (AER) to Bariloche (BRC) - 2 hours 10 minutes

Cordoba (COR) to Bariloche (BRC) - 2 hours 15 minutes

Mendoza (MDZ) to Bariloche (BRC) - 1 hour 45 minutes

Rosario (ROS) to Bariloche (BRC) - 2 hours 15 minutes

El Calafate (FTE) to Bariloche (BRC) - 1 hour 45 minutes

Renting a car at Bariloche Airport

Once you land in Bariloche, you can pick up a rental car at the airport, though it is advised you reserve a vehicle ahead of time.

This is an especially good idea if you're planning a northern Patagonia road trip and will be hitting up some of the neighbouring mountain towns like San Martin de Los Andes, Villa La Angostura, Esquel and El Bolson, just to name a few.

At the airport, you'll find the following providers:

Hertz

Localiza

Avis

Europcar

Alamo

Sixt

Fit

Atua

It is a 15-kilometre drive from Bariloche Airport to Bariloche and it takes about 25 minutes to get there.

TIP: If you are not renting a car, you can get from the airport to the city by hopping in a taxi or remis, or for an even more budget-friendly option, you can take Bus #72 which is a 42-minute journey. 

Getting to Bariloche by Bus

Bariloche is very well connected with the rest of the country with bus links to most major cities. The distances are long, but most journeys are overnight which makes the trip feel shorter and more bearable.

For a more comfortable journey, choose your seat category wisely! Bus seat categories aboard Argentine buses include Cama Suite reclining at 180 degrees, Cama Ejecutivo reclining at 160 degrees, and Semi Cama reclining at 120 degrees.

Sometimes it's worth paying a few extra pesos for more comfort, especially if you're undertaking a long overnight bus journey.

What bus companies go to Bariloche

Buenos Aires to Bariloche - Via TAC, Via Bariloche, Chevallier

Mendoza to Bariloche - Tramat, CATA

Book your tickets via BusBud.

Bus travel is a great way to get around Patagonia, especially if you want to explore a wide range of destinations. If you have the time, you can travel from Ushuaia to Bariloche by bus. Yes, it's a multi-day journey, but you can break it up into smaller segments and see the length of Patagonia in the process.

TIP: The further south you travel in Patagonia, the more remote it gets. This means less bus frequency between destinations, especially if you are travelling off-season. Because not every destination offers daily departures, you’ll want to book your transportation before you reserve your accommodations!

Getting to Bariloche by Train

Another way to get to Bariloche is by train, though the schedule is limited and therefore requires some advance planning.

Tren Patagónico is the train that runs between Viedma and Bariloche. This is an 800+ kilometres journey from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean to the foot of the Andes Mountains and it's a great way to soak in the beauty of the Patagonian steppe.

The Tren Patagónico typically runs from Viedma to Bariloche on Fridays, departing Viedma at 18:00 and arriving in Bariloche at 12:28 the following day.

It then runs from Bariloche to Viedma on Sundays, departing Bariloche at 17:00 and arriving in Viedma at 11:34 the following day.

Since the train to Bariloche only runs once a week, you need to arrange your travel dates accordingly. You can check the schedule and book tickets on Tren Patagónico's official website (Spanish only).

Tip: The Trén Patagónico is not to be confused with the Old Patagonian Express. These are two different trains: the former crosses the width of Argentina, and the latter is a sightseeing narrow gauge steam train that runs three different segments in Patagonia, the most popular one being in Esquel. 

Getting to Bariloche by Car

Can I drive from Buenos Aires to Bariloche?

Technically, you can, but it is a 1,578-kilometre journey that takes about 18 hours to complete and that's with no major traffic incidents along the way.

People do drive to Bariloche from Buenos Aires regularly, but if you decide to do so, you may want to consider breaking up the journey into 2 or 3 days worth of driving to make the long distances a bit more bearable.

Bariloche sits right along National Route 40 or Ruta 40, the longest route in South America stretching 5,194 kilometres from La Quiaca, Jujuy in the north to Cabo Vírgenes, Santa Cruz in the south. That means if you're doing an epic cross-country road trip, you'll hit Bariloche during your journey.

TIP: Fuel up at the gas station when you see one because once you start driving across the Pampas and the Patagonian steppe, you can travel long distances before you see any signs of civilization.

It has multiple transportation links including direct flights to most Argentine cities, as well as interprovincial buses and a twice-weekly train from Buenos Aires.

In this guide, we'll be showing you some of the different ways of getting to Cordoba, so that you can start planning your trip.

Flights to Cordoba

If you're flying to Cordoba, you'll arrive at Ingeniero Aeronáutico Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport (COR), locally known as Pajas Blancas.

Cordoba's airport is situated 15 kilometres north of the city centre and it's a 25-minute drive without traffic.

Pajas Blancas receives domestic flights from all over Argentina as well as international flights from destinations as far as Madrid, Panama, Lima, Resistencia and Santiago del Chile.

Tip: This may seem very obvious, but it's also an easy mistake to make. When booking your flight to Cordoba, Argentina make sure you don't accidentally book yourself a flight to Cordoba, Spain! Both cities share the same name. The airport code for Cordoba, Argentina is COR while the airport code for Cordoba, Spain is ODB. 

Renting a Car at Cordoba Airport

Once you land in Cordoba, you can pick up a rental car at the airport, though it is advised you reserve a vehicle ahead of time. This is an especially good idea if you’re planning a road trip to the Sierras. The best way to explore these small mountain towns is with a vehicle since buses can be less frequent.

The following car rental providers are available at the airport:

Hertz

Avis

Localiza

Alamo National

Europcar

Tip: If you are not renting a car, you can get to the city by hopping in a taxi or remis, or for an even more budget-friendly option, you can take the AeroBus which runs from the airport to the bus terminal.

Buses to Cordoba

Because Cordoba is situated in the centre of Argentina, it is a major transportation hub with bus links that connect it to the rest of the country.

Buses arrive and depart from Terminal de Ómnibus de Córdoba. You have the Terminal de Omnibus T1 sometimes called the 'Terminal Vieja' (Old Terminal), and the Nueva Terminal de Omnibus T2 known as the 'Terminal Nueva' (new terminal).

The two terminals are located right next to each other, so if you end up at the wrong one, you just have to walk across the street to the other one.

Long-distance bus rides across the country generally leave from the old terminal, while more regional routes to the Sierras and cities within the province leave from the new terminal. That being said, always confirm when buying your ticket as there can be exceptions.

Tip: If you're travelling long distances, choose your seat category wisely! Argentine buses have the following classes: Cama Suite with seats that recline 180 degrees, Cama Ejecutivo at 160 degrees, and Semi Cama at 120 degrees. Sometimes it’s worth paying a few extra pesos for a more comfortable trip, especially if you're catching an overnight bus.

Train to Cordoba

Buenos Aires to Cordoba Train

It is possible to travel by train from Buenos Aires to Cordoba aboard the Retiro-Córdoba long-distance train operated by Trenes Argentinos.

This same train then runs from Cordoba to Buenos Aires on Mondays and Fridays leaving at 20:08 and arriving at 16:40 the following afternoon.

Driving to Cordoba

Can I drive from Buenos Aires to Cordoba?

It's certainly possible to do so. The drive from Buenos Aires to Cordoba is around 700 kilometres and takes 7 hours and 20 minutes to complete, as long as there is no major traffic leaving or entering the city.

The highways and roads are well-maintained and well-signalled. To make the drive, you take National Route 9 (Ruta Nacional 9), which connects the two cities and passes through Rosario.

Before embarking on your trip, plan your route, make sure your vehicle is in working order, and if you're unfamiliar with the area, consider having a map or GPS device to help you navigate.

The drive can be done in one day, but remember to take breaks during your journey to rest and refuel as needed.

553158cd4e276b3cdc56a82c93a005af7fe4f74f,che_argentina_travel,en,How to Get to Perito Moreno Glacier from El Calafate,"Wondering how to get to Perito Moreno Glacier from El Calafate? We're going to share the different options you have. 

No trip to El Calafate would be complete without spending at least one full day exploring Los Glaciares National Park and seeing the iconic Perito Moreno Glacier. 

This glacier is the top attraction in the region and it's the main reason visitors come all the way down to El Calafate in the first place!

But how do you get to Perito Moreno Glacier and what's there to see and do once you're there? Well, we've got you covered. 

This is our complete guide to visiting Perito Moreno Glacier and we're going to share how to get there, what tours you can take, park entrance fees, opening hours, and lots of other essential info and practical travel tips.

How to get to El Calafate

First things first, if you want to visit Perito Moreno Glacier, you need to make your way to El Calafate. This town is the gateway to Los Glaciares National Park and Perito Moreno Glacier.

You do NOT want to go to the town of Perito Moreno. Even though it shares the same name as the glacier, this town is in fact 629 kilometres away in the opposite end of the Santa Cruz Province. 

I repeat, you want to go to El Calafate to see the Perito Moreno Glacier, and Perito Moreno to see the Cave of Hands. 

This would be a very easy mistake to make, especially if you're travelling across Patagonia by bus. 

You can get to El Calafate by airplane from Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Ushuaia, or by bus from El Chalten or Puerto Natales, Chile. 

How to get to Perito Moreno Glacier

There are several different ways to get to Perito Moreno Glacier, so let's start with the most affordable option and work our way up from there!

The travel time from El Calafate to Perito Moreno Glacier is 1.5 hours whether you take a bus, taxi or drive your rental car.

Take a bus to the glacier

The cheapest and easiest way to get to Perito Moreno Glacier is by taking a bus. 

Buses depart from the El Calafate Bus Terminal and take you straight into Los Glaciares National Park. 

The main bus companies that travel to the park are Cal Tur, Chaltén Travel and Marga Taqsa. 

If you're visiting during high season, I would recommend booking your bus tickets to the park in advance. You can do so via a travel agency in town or by walking over to the bus station on the edge of town (that's what we did!). There is a limited number of buses making the journey each day, so you want to make sure you get a seat. 

Also, book a round-trip ticket so you don't get stranded at the park at the end of the day! Otherwise, you'll have to call a taxi to come and get you. 

Take a taxi or remis

The next option to get from El Calafate to Perito Moreno Glacier is to take a taxi or remis.

In Argentina, a remis refers to a private car that you can book via an agency. It looks like a regular car (it's not painted yellow nor does it have any distinguishing features), it does not have a meter, and the prices are pre-determined based on the destination. You know the price of the journey before you even get in the car. 

There are several remis agencies in El Calafate and we used them a couple of times to get around and reach some of the further attractions. 

These include: Taxi Remis Calafate Viajes Turísticos, Taxi Remis Los Andes, Taxis Remis El Puma and Taxi Remis Condor. 

If you're concerned about paying a fair price, ask for an estimate at your hotel or guesthouse. They should be in the know or at the very least they can recommend a reputable remis agency that they use with their guests.

This might be a good option if you're travelling with a group of friends and you can split the cost 3 or 4 ways.

Rent a car and drive yourself

Getting from El Calafate to Perito Moreno Glacier by car is another option and it's the one that provides the most flexibility. You can drive out to Los Glaciares National Park and back when you please and stop at panoramic points along the way. 

The only downside is that renting a car in Argentina isn't particularly cheap and in Patagonia, there often isn't a lot of availability. 

The other thing to keep in mind is that most rental cars in Argentina are manual transmission, while in North America we're used to driving automatic transmission. 

I've rented cars in Argentina several times in different parts of the country and what I've found is that automatic cars can go for up to 3 times the cost of renting a manual. So that's a major consideration.

Also, renting a car in Patagonia is more expensive than renting elsewhere in Argentina! Manual cars in El Calafate start out at $60 USD per day and automatic cars go for $100 per day. This is the minimum price, it can go up from there based on demand, time of year, and the type of vehicle you choose. 

If you're interested in driving in Argentina, I would recommend having a look at Discover Cars. They are a car rental comparison website with an aggregate search tool that helps you find the best car deals available. 

If you decide to go this route, book your rental car in advance. Don't try to do so once you land at El Calafate Airport, because you're almost guaranteed to be out of luck!

You can browse car rentals in El Calafate here. 

Join a tour to Perito Moreno Glacier

Another way to get to Perito Moreno Glacier is by joining a guided tour that includes transportation to and from the park. These tours are done as a day trip from El Calafate. 

There are all sorts of tours to Perito Moreno Glacier including ice trekking tours, scenic boat tours, and even walking tours of the boardwalks. 

Mini Trekking Excursion on Perito Moreno Glacier: This glacier trek includes transportation to and from the park. Once you arrive at the park, you board a vessel at Bajo de las Sombras and cross over to the glacier. You are then geared up with crampons and ice axes to begin the trek. This glacier trek has a maximum of 20 participants per guide. 

Perito Moreno Glacier with Navigation: This tour to Perito Moreno Glacier includes hotel pick up and drop off. Once you arrive at the park, you have time to visit the walkways and balconies for different perspectives of the glacier. During the navigation, you will sail around the south face of Perito Moreno which rises 60 meters above the water. The boat ride is 1 hour in length. 

Sightseeing Glaciers Cruise: This is a full-day sightseeing boat tour where you get to see numerous glaciers and icebergs! It takes you to parts of the national park that would otherwise be impossible to reach. You can read about our experience of the Gourmet Glaciers tour aboard Maria Turquesa here.

Footbridges of Perito Moreno Glacier: This tour is basically private transportation to Perito Moreno Glacier. Once you arrive, you have free time to explore the walkways on your own. This is where you get to see Perito Moreno Glacier from the balconies. At the end of the day, you ride back to El Calafate and you can get dropped off at your hotel or in the centre of town.

Note: Keep in mind that even if you book a tour to Los Glaciares National Park, you will still need to pay the park admission fee separately. More on that below. 

Los Glaciares National Park Info

Los Glaciares National Park was created in 1937 and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981. It is home to the third-largest continental ice field on the planet and to numerous glaciers, including Perito Moreno Glacier, which is one of the few advancing glaciers in the world.

About Perito Moreno Glacier

Perito Moreno Glacier is one of the most impressive natural wonders in South America.

The glacier is named after Francisco Moreno, an early pioneer who studied the region during the 19th century and played a crucial role in defending Argentina's territory in the conflict surrounding a border dispute with Chile.

Francisco Moreno was locally known as Perito, which means 'specialist' or 'expert' and that's how the name Perito Moreno came to be. 

This sprawling glacier covers an area of roughly 250 square kilometres and forms part of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which is the third-largest freshwater reserve in the world!

What sets Perito Moreno Glacier apart from other glaciers it that its very active. In fact, it's one of the few advancing glaciers on Earth.

The glacier's tip reaches the shores of Lago Argentino, and as it advances, it periodically forms a natural dam that blocks the waters of the Brazo Rico from the rest of the lake.

Pressure builds up during this period, eventually causing a massive calving event where the ice dam breaks and giant chunks of ice fly into the lake in a dramatic fashion. This event is something that occurs every 4 to 5 years.

Boardwalks and Trails

There are different boardwalks and trails to enjoy when visiting Perito Moreno Glacier. The Pasarelas section of Los Glaciares National Park has the following options:

Central Circuit: 600 metres – 1:00 hs – Easy

Lower Circuit: 1100 metres – 1:15 hs – Challenging

Forest Trail: 570 metres – 0:45 hs – Moderate

Shoreline Trail: 1117 metres – 1:30 hs – Moderate

Accessible Circuit: 565 metres – 0:30 hs – Very easy

Tip: For the best hiking in Los Glaciares National Park, you'll want to spend a few days in El Chaltén. This town is considered the trekking capital of Argentina and it's located inside the northern portion of the park. In contrast, El Calafate is in the south end of the park and La Leona is in the middle. 

Eating in the national park

Whether you're visiting Perito Moreno Glacier independently or as part of a tour, you should be prepared to spend most of the day in the park and outdoors. That means you will get hungry at some point, so it's good to think about lunch. 

You can bring your own packed lunch which is what most visitors do. There are benches on the balconies that overlook the glacier, so you can stop to rest and enjoy a bite (granola bars, nuts, fruit, a sandwich, etc). Just remember that everything you bring in must also be carried out!

Alternatively, there is one restaurant inside the park and that's Nativos de la Patagonia. This is a good option if you'd prefer a sit-down meal and a place to warm up. The restaurant offers both a la carte and buffet dining options. We got some grilled sandwiches and baked goods for our meal. 

What to wear at Perito Moreno Glacier

Another important consideration when visiting Perito Moreno Glacier is what to wear. Keep in mind, that it's going to be much colder at the glacier than it is in the town of El Calafate.

Your best bet is to dress in layers that you can add and remove as the weather changes, and the weather will change, because this is Patagonia!

I would recommend 3 layers: a quick-drying shirt, a fleece and a rainproof jacket. You'll want something heavier if you're visiting in winter.

Plus, a hat, scarf and gloves. You'll want these in the early morning and late afternoon year-round.

In terms of footwear, trekking shoes are fine - you'll pack these anyway if you're planning to visit El Chaltén! The boardwalks and trails are super easy so you won't need trekking poles here.

Getting to Ushuaia by car

How many kilometres from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia?

It is a 3,076 km or 1,911 mi journey to drive from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia.

Whichever route you choose to drive across Argentina - be it along the Atlantic Coast or the Andes Mountains - there will come a point in the road where you have to cross into Chile in order to reach Isla Grande, the island in Tierra del Fuego where Ushuaia is located.

Since you are reaching an island, this also involves a Chilean ferry in order to make it across the Strait of Magellan.

Crossing the border via Rio Gallegos

Leaving Rio Gallegos, you will head south on RN3 until you reach Paso Internacional Integración Austral. Here you'll go through customs and immigration, scan your bags and get your passport stamped.

You will then continue south on Ruta 255 and then turn off on Ruta 257 heading in the direction of Cruce Punta Delgada.

Crossing the border via El Calafate

If you're travelling in El Calafate and you want to explore Chilean Patagonia, you'll likely cross over to Chile to visit Torres del Paine, Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas.

This route involves driving south on RN40 and turning off towards Paso Río Don Guillermo, which is the international border crossing into Chile.

After going through customs and immigration, you will continue south on Ruta 9, catch the 255 heading east, and the 257 heading south until you reach Cruce Punta Delgada to catch the ferry.

TIP: Whichever crossing you choose, you will want to allow ample time at immigration as it can take time depending on the number of buses and vehicles crossing at the same time. 

Ferry Crossing to Tierra del Fuego

The ferry crosses from Punta Delgada (on the continent) to Bahia Azul (on the island) at the narrowest part of the Strait of Magellan in what is known as the Primera Angostura Crossing.

The island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego is shared between Argentina and Chile. You will first be crossing into the Chilean side.

Roll-On Roll-Off (RoRo) service is offered by Transbordadora Austral Broom via its three vessels: Ferry Fueguino, Ferry Patagonia, and Ferry Crux Australis.

The ferry terminal operates every day from 08:30 a.m. (on the continent) to 01:00 a.m. (on the island). You can view the crossing schedule here.

Reservations for this ferry crossing are not required, you simply arrive during the hours of operation and it's first come first serve.

Once you've crossed on the ferry, you continue driving south on Ruta 257 until you reach Paso Fronterizo San Sebastian and cross over from Chile back into Argentina.

You then follow RN3 all the way south until you reach Ushuaia.

TIP: You can take RN3 all the way to the 'End of the Road Sign' in Bahía Lapataia in Tierra del Fuego National Park. That's where this epic road officially ends. There's nothing to do here but to turn back around and drive up to Alaska!

This village is a great destination for a day trip from Bariloche since it is located just 25 kilometres outside the city. Plus, it's a fun destination where you can eat Swiss/German food, enjoy some beach time, visit one of the best craft breweries in Patagonia, meet mythical forest creatures and so much more!

Colonia Suiza doesn't have a lot of infrastructure in terms of accommodations, however, it is a popular camping destination and there are a handful of bunkies for those who want to stay overnight. 

In this travel guide, we'll share exactly how you can visit Colonia Suiza from Bariloche and everything you can see and do once you're there.

A brief history of Colonia Suiza

Colonia Suiza was founded in the late 19th century by the Goye family who were originally from the Canton of Valais in Switzerland. 

They first arrived in Chile where they settled and worked for a few years. However, they eventually crossed the Andes Mountain Range to reach Argentina, and it wasn't long before others also followed.

Though many Swiss immigrants initially settled in Chile, a number of them were drawn to the region around Bariloche. Not only did the lakes and forests remind them of their homeland, but the fertile land also offered them better opportunities for farming.

Many of these Swiss families who crossed over settled at the foot of Cerro Lopez and worked in agriculture, grinding grain by hand and shipping these goods over to Chile via the Andean lakes on ships that they also built themselves.

Aside from that, they planted orchards with cherries, plums, peaches, apples and pears, and used these fruits to elaborate the jams the Swiss colony is now known for.

How to get to Colonia Suiza

There are a few different ways to get to Colonia Suiza from Bariloche so we're going to outline all of those options:

Car

If you feel confident driving in Argentina, you may want to consider renting a car for greater mobility. Colonia Suiza is located 24 kilometres from Bariloche and it is a 36-minute drive to get there. 

You'll head west on Avenida Exequiel Bustillo which follows the lakeshore. You'll then take the second exit onto Circuito Chico/RP77 and turn left onto Genoveva Beveraggi shortly after. 

Bus

You can also reach Colonia Suiza from Bariloche by bus, which is what we did. 

You can catch Bus 10 in Bariloche either at the Bus Terminal or Centro. This bus only stops in Colonia Suiza a few times a day, so you'll want to check the schedule.

If your bus doesn't stop in Colonia Suiza, you'll want to get off at the roundabout at Km 18 and then transfer to Bus 13.

As you'll notice on the schedules, buses are not very frequent, so you'll want to time your return right. Don't miss the last bus because you'll have to either hitchhike or call a taxi to get back to Bariloche.

Bike

If you'd rather have a more active day, another way to reach Colonia Suiza is by bike. 

You can rent a mountain bike or electric bike in Bariloche at Patagonia Bike Trips or Circuito Chico Adventure. This option allows you to embark on your own self-guided tour of Circuito Chico and Colonia Suiza.

While Avenida Exequiel Bustillo has a steady flow of traffic, you can opt to take the back way to Colonia Suiza via Ruta Provincial 79, an old dirt road that is seldom used by vehicles. 

Things to Do in Colonia Suiza

Artesanal Fair

One of the main things to do in Colonia Suiza is to visit the Artesanal Fair in the centre of town.

Known locally as the Feria Artesanal, this is a market that sets up on Sundays and Wednesdays (during high season) and it's a nice place to pick up some regional souvenirs.

Here you can purchase all sorts of handcrafted and local goods like jams, honey, artisanal chocolate, lavender soaps, wood carvings, knit sweaters, ponchos and so much more.

Across the fair, you'll also find the Patio de Comidas, which is an outdoor food court surrounded by stalls selling empanadas, hamburgers, choripan (sausage on a bun) and lots of other quick meals. 

Colonia Suiza Beach

Another reason to visit Colonia Suiza - especially in the summertime! - is to enjoy some beach time.

If you walk down the narrow dirt trail known as Primeros Pobladores, you'll reach the pebbly shores of Lake Perito Moreno. This is a nice spot to spend the day, enjoy a picnic, and cool down with a swim. 

There are also two kayak and canoe outfitters if you're up for an adventure; look out for Lafken or Dharma Kayak along the lakeshore.

Canopy Bariloche

If you're looking for some thrills in Colonia Suiza, you'll be happy to hear about Canopy Bariloche. Located on the outskirts of town at the base of Cerro Lopez, this is an outdoor adventure park where you can go ziplining.

The adventure kicks off with a 4x4 ride up the mountaintop to the first platform where you'll begin your flight through the forest. 

The total route is 1,500 meters long making it one of the longest ziplines in South America and it has a total of 10 different platforms.

It takes about 2 hours to complete the full ziplining circuit. 

You can book your Canopy Bariloche Ziplining Tour here. This one includes transportation to and from Bariloche and you get to do the full 10-platform circuit.

Aldea Duende

If you're looking for a quirky attraction in Colonia Suiza, consider Aldea Duende, which translates to 'elf village'.

Truth is, we had no idea what the Elf Village was all about when we set foot in there, but it turned out to be quite entertaining, especially if you come with a vivid imagination. 

We were led into the forest by our guide who taught us to identify all sorts of trees and mushrooms, but then, he brought us to meet the creatures of the forest. 

During the tour, we met all sorts of mythical beings like the Gridman who can become part of nature, Leprechauns who like to guard their pot of gold, and mischievous elves who steal trinkets (now you know who to blame when things go missing in your home!). There were also trolls, witches and forest fairies.

Technically Aldea Duende is geared toward children, however, there were other adults there as well - there are only so many sights in Colonia Suiza!

What to Eat in Colonia Suiza

There are three unique food experiences you can have in Colonia Suiza: try Swiss/German food which was brought over by the early settlers, eat a curanto meal which the same early settlers picked up on their way here from Chile, and sip some of the best craft beers in all of Argentina!

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Colonia Suiza (@coloniasuizabariloche)

Eat a traditional Curanto meal 

If there's one dish to try when you visit Colonia Suiza, it's curanto. This is a dish with deep roots in the culture of the indigenous Mapuche and Huilliche peoples of Chile and it is a feast that brings the community together.

Curanto is traditionally prepared in coastal areas of Chile, however, it was brought over to Colonia Suiza by the Swiss settlers who had previously settled in Chile and learned to prepare the dishes of that region.

""In Argentina, curanto was introduced in the late 19th century by a group of Swiss-French pioneers, who arrived in the south of the country having traveled through Chile. They settled in a place known today as Colonia Suiza, near Bariloche, in the province of Río Negro.""- Gustar via Google Arts and Culture

The most authentic way to prepare curanto is in a curanto al hoyo which translates to 'curanto in the hole'. This is a process where a large hole is dug in the ground and lined with hot stones.

Layers of ingredients are then placed over the stones, each separated by large leaves. The hole is then covered with more leaves and soil to trap the steam, creating a natural oven effect. The ingredients cook for several hours, absorbing the smoky, earthy flavours.

Like with most attractions in town, you'll need to visit on a Sunday or a Wednesday (during high tourist season) to enjoy this culinary experience.

Try Swiss and German Food

Seeing as Colonia Suiza was founded by Swiss settlers, you can find some excellent Swiss and German food in town. Here is a selection of some restaurants to check out:

Aire Sur - this is where we ate on our day trip to Colonia Suiza. We got the Papas Rósti, shredded potato pancakes with onions and bacon; and the Goulash with Spaetzle, a meat stew with paprika served with noodles. 

Fundo - the cheese fondue is one of the specialties, plus you can also get burgers, pasta and trout dishes.

Zurich - this restaurant serves up a mix of European and Argentine dishes including classics like Spaetzle with Goulash and Patagonian Lamb Stew.

Casita Strudel - as the name suggests, this little dessert house specializes in Strudel, a layered pastry filled with walnuts, apples, cinnamon and raisins. They also sell cookies, alfajores and coffee to go.

Sip craft beers at Cerveza Berlina

At the edge of town, you'll find Cerveza Berlina also known as Berlina Patagonian Brewery, one of the more famous breweries in Bariloche.

This microbrewery was started by three brothers: Franco, Guido and Bruno Ferrari.

They originally opened a brewpub in Bariloche in 2004 and then moved their production to Colonia Suiza in 2008, where all their beer is now manufactured.

Since then, Berlina has become an award-winning brewery; they were voted the best craft brewery in Argentina in 2017 and also came in second for best brewery in South America that same year. 

Berlina elaborates 30 types of beers annually including some seasonal and limited edition beers. These include a Chocolate Imperial Stout, American Pale Ale, Hefeweizen, Pumpkin Ale, Patagonia Barley Wine and more.

Where to Stay in Colonia Suiza

Accommodations in Colonia Suiza are quite limited. Because there are only a handful of options to choose from - mainly camping sites and bunkies! - this destination is especially appealing to backpackers and budget travellers.

The campsites in Colonia Suiza include Camping Goye, Camping Huenei Ruca (on the beach), Camping Ser and Camping SAC.

Alternatively, if you want something a bit closer to Colonia Suiza without staying in Bariloche, you can consider some of the cottages (like La Huala or Cabañita en el Bosque) or guesthouses (like Hosteria Las Cartas or Bosque del Nahuel) along the southern loop of Circuito Chico.

That's right! Set on a peninsula that juts out from the town of Villa La Angostura, is a forest locally known as Bosque de Arrayanes.

This forest is home to the famous arrayán tree which has a flakey cinnamon-coloured bark with cream patches. The unique thing about this tree is that it always feels cool to the touch because its bark is so thin that you can feel the sap flowing within!

The main part of the Arrayanes Forest is found on the tip of the Quetrihué Peninsula on the shore of Nahuel Huapi Lake. Fun fact: the name Quetrihué means 'where the Arrayanes are' in the Mapuche language.

Most of the trees in the Arrayanes Forest are around 300 years old, though there are some specimens over 650 years of age.

Los Arrayanes National Park is an iconic destination in northern Patagonia and it's best done as a full-day trip that includes a boat tour to the peninsula, a visit to the Arrayanes Forest and then a 12-kilometre hike back to Villa La Angostura.

How to visit the Arrayanes Forest

You can visit the Arrayanes Forest from the town of Villa La Angostura or from the neighbouring city of Bariloche.

From Bariloche, it's a 1 hour and 30-minute drive to the port which is located in Bahía Mansa. Meanwhile, from Villa La Angostura, it's a short 7-minute drive to the port, which you can reach by taxi or bus.

Once you arrive at the pier Muelle Modesta Victoria, it's time to choose your boat! And there are numerous options ranging from catamarans to motorboats to sailboats.

We went with Bahia Mansa Excursiones on a motorboat, so it was a small group size and the captain also shared lots of information and fun facts on the journey over to the Arrayanes Forest.

Catamarán Futaleufú is another popular option if you prefer a larger vessel.

The boat journey takes 30 minutes and you are treated to views of forested mountains while the boat zips through the lake and the fresh Patagonian breeze whips through your hair.

You also have to pay the admission fee to Los Arrayanes National Park before boarding. We paid the equivalent of $8 USD per person as international visitors.

Tip: You can visit the Arrayanes Forest from Bariloche as part of another lake excursion that covers Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest. This is a completely different route but you do get 45 minutes in the forest if that works better with your travel itinerary. 

Walk the Arrayanes Forest Boardwalk

If you're visiting as part of a guided tour, as soon as you disembark on the peninsula, you'll do a guided walk along part of the Arrayanes Forest boardwalk.

This is called the Circuito Principal and it's an 800-metre boardwalk that goes through the Arrayanes Forest and takes about 30 minutes to complete.

There are a few stairs, but it is considered low difficulty.

It can get a little bit crowded on the boardwalk during high season when several boats arrive at the same time, but since it's a brief visit for most, the crowds disperse fairly quickly.

So, if you're planning to hike back to Villa La Angostura and you don't mind waiting a bit for the excursions to leave, you can have the whole Arrayanes Forest to yourself.

Arrayanes Forest and Walt Disney?

The Arrayanes Forest is said to have inspired Disney's 1942 film Bambi.

Walt Disney travelled extensively across Argentina in 1941 just one year before the film's release, so there's good reason to believe this is true.

Plus, Disney also incorporated many gaucho elements from this trip into some of his other works like Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).

It's worth noting that this was not his only visit to Argentina as he would return again for more inspiration.

Visit the Arrayanes Tea House

The Arrayanes Forest Tea House is another must-visit spot on the peninsula. It's only 100 meters from the pier, so just follow the signs that read Casa de Té.

This cozy log cabin dates back to 1933 and it is locally known as 'la casita de Bambi' or 'Bambi's House'.

Luckily, the tea house was open on the day we visited, so we got to enjoy a nice lunch of ham and cheese sandwiches, lemon meringue pie, Rogel cake (a traditional Argentine dessert consisting of thin flakey layers filled with dulce de leche and topped with meringue), and raspberry tea. We paid $16 USD for our lunch.

The interior of the Arrayanes tea house is very cozy and rustic with long tables and benches where guests can intermingle. They also have a wood-burning stove in one corner, so it's a nice place to warm up and enjoy a bite, especially if you're planning to hike back across the peninsula.

Tip: It's hard to tell whether the tea house will be open or not - though your chances are far better during high season! That being said, it's not a bad idea to bring some snacks. There are numerous shops back near the port before you board the boat, where you can buy things like sandwiches, pizzas, chips, and chocolate bars. 

Hike across Los Arrayanes National Park

If you're a hiker and you want to enjoy the natural beauty of Patagonia, then you should consider hiking the length of Los Arrayanes National Park.

The 12-kilometre trail runs from the Arrayanes Forest on the tip of the Quetrihué Peninsula to the port of Villa La Angostura.

The journey takes 3 hours to complete and goes past two lagoons: Laguna Patagua and Laguna Hua Huan.

Once you get off the boardwalk and onto the trail, the path is well-marked and it's a very straightforward hike. Most of the trail is flat, though you do encounter a few steeper parts towards the end.

One of the highlights was reaching the panoramic point at the end of the hike, which offers beautiful views of the forested mountains, the snowy peaks, and the waters of Bahía Mansa which range from turquoise to cerulean.

We were really glad we opted to do the hike, and we were also surprised there weren't more people doing so! It's worth adding to your list of destinations to visit in Patagonia.

If you're not an avid hiker, then of course, you can take the boat back to Villa La Angostura - just make sure you pay for a round-trip journey.

You also have the option of doing a mountain biking tour - we noticed quite a few cyclists on the trail. Be prepared for a ride on relatively uneven terrain with plenty of knobby roots on the path and some fallen tree logs.

The Los Arrayanes hiking trail ends back in the port between Bahía Mansa and Bahía Brava, where you can easily find a taxi and get back into town. Otherwise, if your legs can handle it, it's another 3.6-kilometres to Villa La Angostura!

Lastly, if you're looking for other fun day trips in the area, don't miss out on the Road of the Seven Lakes, a scenic 107-kilometre drive that stretches between the towns of Villa La Angostura and San Martín de los Andes. It's considered one of the most beautiful drives in all of Argentina.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,f707f7fb313e2090afc6a908f087839bf194ac5f

With its imposing neoclassical columns, massive bronze-plated dome, and granite exterior, it's quite the sight to behold. But did you know you can also go inside, and that it is free to visit?

That’s right! The National Congress of Argentina offers free guided tours that let you step behind the grand doors and explore one of the country’s most important buildings.

Whether you’re interested in politics, architecture, or simply love a good behind-the-scenes experience, this is a fascinating stop to add to your Buenos Aires itinerary.

It took me about 3 attempts to finally tour the Argentine National Congress, and this is because tours cannot take place when there is parliamentary activity. So there's a bit of luck involved, but I also learned a lot about the booking process during my failed attempts!

So here’s everything you need to know about visiting the National Congress, including how to book your tour, what you’ll see inside, and some handy tips for making the most of your visit.

A Brief History of the National Congress

The idea of building a monumental legislative palace came at a time when Argentina was emerging as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. 

Construction began in 1897, at the height of the country’s Belle Époque, when Buenos Aires was striving to position itself as the “Paris of South America.”

The project was designed by Italian architect Vittorio Meano, the same mind behind the Teatro Colón. His vision drew heavily on neoclassical European architecture, with a commanding façade, elegant Corinthian columns, and a central dome rising 80 meters high.

The building was inaugurated in 1906, though work continued for several decades afterward to complete the interiors.

Today, the Palacio del Congreso houses both chambers of the legislature: the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). 

Over its 100+ years, it has been the setting for pivotal moments in Argentina’s political life, from the passage of major laws to protests and demonstrations that frequently unfold in the square outside (hence the gates you'll notice around Plaza del Congreso).

Check official site.💰 CostFree📝 BookingIn person and bring photo ID⏱ Tour Duration45–60 minutes🌐 LanguagesSpanish and English🪪 RequirementsPassport or DNI for entry, early arrival for security

How to Get to the National Congress

The Argentine National Congress sits on the western end of Avenida de Mayo, the historic boulevard that links it with Plaza de Mayo and the Casa Rosada (the Presidential Palace) on the eastern end.

Subte: Take subway Line A to Congreso station and you'll see the building right outside the exit.

Bus: Numerous colectivos (buses) stop in and around Plaza del Congreso.

On foot: If you’re exploring central Buenos Aires, it’s an easy and beautiful walk down Avenida de Mayo from Plaza de Mayo (about 15–20 minutes).

How to Book a Tour of Congress

The best part about booking a tour of Argentina's National Congress, is that the tours are free!

Here’s how it works:

Guided tours run Monday to Friday at 12:00 and 17:00 if you go via the Senate. And they run Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday at 11:00 and 17:00 in Spanish, and at 13:00 and 15:00 in Spanish and English if you go via the Deputies. Tours offered via the Senate and Deputies are exactly the same.

Now, that I've told you the schedule, I'm going to throw a curveball and let you know that these time slots can and will be cancelled at the very last minute due activity in parliament! You need to be flexible and prepared for plans to change at the drop of a hat.

In order to find a scheduled tour, you need to visit the official Senate website. Then, scroll down the homepage to the Agenda de Actividades (Activities Agenda), where you'll want to find a Visita guiada al Palacio Legislativo (Guided visit of the Legislative Palace). 

You'll be able to see on what dates these guided tours are scheduled, and you'll want to double check the day before you go to make sure the tour has not been cancelled!

Then, you'll arrive at the National Congress building and make your way to Hipólito Yrigoyen 1863 (it is the third door on the south side of the congress building.) 

You will want to arrive 30 minutes before the tour's scheduled start time. A maximum of 30 guests can join these guided visits, and you cannot reserve a spot in advance. It's first come, first served!

You can also book this exact same tour through the official Diputados website and follow the same steps. The only difference is that their entrance is on the north side of the building at Avenida Rivadavia 1864.

Shortly before the start of the tour, guests will be divided into Spanish and English-language tours. You'll then make your way through security and enter the building with your assigned guide. 

Note that some days only include a guided visit of the Legislative Palace, while other days also include the Parliamentary Museum. We did not get to see the museum on the day of our visit.

IMPORTANT: Bring your passport or DNI as identification is required in order to enter the building. You will also need to pass through airport-style security before the tour.

What You’ll See on the Tour of Congress

Stepping inside the Palace of the Argentine National Congress feels grand. It is an architectural work of art made up of grand marble staircases, echoing halls, and salons filled with chandeliers.

Here are some of the spaces you can expect to visit, keeping in mind that some of these salons may be skipped if in use:

Hall of Lost Steps

The Hall of Lost Steps, or Salón de Pasos Perdidos, is a grand hall that acts as the antechamber to the Chamber of Deputies. It houses stained-glass windows on the ceiling depicting agriculture, justice, science, the arts, and commerce.

This rooms holds two important paintings. You can see Los Constituyentes del ‘53 by Antonio Alice, which portrays the members of the 1853 Constituent Congress, a pivotal moment in Argentine history when the constitution was drafted and proclaimed. 

You can also see El Presidente Roca inaugura el periodo legislativo del año 1886 by Juan Manuel Blanes, depicting Argentine President Julio A. Roca giving his speech at the opening of the legislative session in 1886.

Salón Azul (The Blue Room)

Salón Libertador General San Martín is often referred to as the Salón Azul or Blue Room due to the color of its curtains and original furniture.

It is an octagonal space located in the center of the building and it forms the base of the imposing dome seen from the outside. It has an enormous bronze chandelier with 331 lights and Baccarat crystal lampshades.

This room is used for press conferences, official ceremonies, and state visits. It’s easily one of the most beautiful rooms in the Palace of the Argentine National Congress.

Salón Rosado (The Pink Room)

This pink-toned salon that was opened by Eva Perón to create a space where female politicians could convene separately from the male chambers. 

Up until 1951, the Pink Room is where women met to discuss policies, and then, their notes would get passed on to a male deputy!

Chamber of Deputies

The legislative sessions of the Lower House are held in the Chamber of Deputies or Cámara de Diputados. It consists of 257 benches arranged in the shape of a semi-circle.

The chamber has three floors of galleries and is crowned by a stained-glass window with the national coat of arms.

Senate Chamber

Located on the opposite side of the building, the Senate Chamber, or Cámara de Senadores, mirrors the grandeur of the Deputies’ chamber but on a smaller scale.

The chamber where the senators meet consists of 72 benches arranged in a semi-circle.

It has two floors of galleries for special guests and the press.

Salón Arturo Illia

The Arturo Umberto Illia Reading Room has historically been a meeting place for senators and served as an antechamber to the session hall, where the final details of speeches and votes were finalized. 

Currently, this room is used for committee meetings, press conferences and formal receptions.

You can see portraits of presidents and vice presidents of the nation along its walls.

Hall of the Provinces

The Salón de las Provincias or Hall of the Provinces holds the 24 flags and coats of arms of all the Argentine provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.

And yes, I did stop and pose next to the Córdoba flag, because I've got to represent my province!

What to Do Nearby Congress

The Congress is located in the heart of Buenos Aires, so there’s plenty to explore before or after your tour:

Aljibe Tango - In case you're looking to watch an early tango show in Buenos Aires.

Café Tortoni – A short stroll down Avenida de Mayo, this historic café has been serving porteños since 1858.

El Imparcial - This bodegón is the oldest restaurant in Buenos Aires and they serve some delicious Spanish-style dishes. This is where I like to eat when I'm in the area!

Palacio Barolo – Another Belle Époque gem just a few blocks away. Its lighthouse dome offers incredible city views. You can read all about my visit to Palacio Barolo here.

Avenida de Mayo Walk – This grand avenue links the Congress to Plaza de Mayo. It’s lined with gorgeous buildings, making it one of the best architecture walks in the city.

If you want to do a bit more exploring, you can check out my Monserrat neighbourhood guide highlighting things to do, where to eat and where to stay. 

And if you happen to be in the city on a day when it is pouring rain, here are some indoor activities you can enjoy across Buenos Aires.

After several days spent touring wineries and vineyards and tasting wine, we decided it was time to see a bit more of Mendoza. We wanted to get out of the city and see the rugged landscapes, so we booked a full-day excursion to the High Mountains.

This tour takes you west of Mendoza City making stops at landmarks like Potrerillos Dam, Uspallata, Puente del Inca, the Aconcagua Lookout Point and the Christ Redeemer of the Andes statue which stands on the border between Argentina and Chile.

We joined a guided bus tour for this Mendoza Andes day tour, however, if you'd prefer to have more control over your schedule, you can either hire a driver for the day or rent a car and visit all of these attractions independently. 

Our Pick

Andes High Mountain Day Tour 

✅ Rated 4.7/5 ⭐✅ 10-12 hour tour✅ Recommended by 94% of travellers

This Andes High Mountain tour departs from Mendoza City and visits Potrerillos Dam, Uspallata, the Inca's Bridge, Aconcagua Lookout Point, Christ Redeemer of the Andes, and Las Cuevas. It's an action-packed full-day tour. 

Potrerillos Dam

Our first stop of the day was the Potrerillos Dam which is located just over an hour’s drive west of Mendoza City.

Locally known as Dique Potrerillos, this is a picturesque reservoir framed by towering Andean peaks and it sits on the Mendoza River at 1,380 metres above sea level.

The dam was completed in the early 2000s and is crucial in supplying water and hydroelectric power to the region. 

It is also a popular recreational spot with locals who come to enjoy a variety of outdoor activities such as kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, and windsurfing.

The tunnel leading to the Potrerillos Dam is called Túnel de Cacheuta and it's a really popular photo op with visitors. It perfectly frames the dam, however, there isn't really enough space to pull over, so it's best to continue to the lookout point to snap your photos.

We had been driving about an hour when we reached Potrerillos, so we enjoyed a quick stop to snap some photos and stretch our legs.

Uspallata

From there, we continued onwards to the town of Uspallata another hour away.

Uspallata is a tranquil valley town that serves as a gateway to Mendoza's High Andes. The town is surrounded by the Cordon del Plata mountain range, and the area’s desert-like scenery features dramatic rock formations and wide-open skies. 

You may be surprised to hear that the 1997 movie Seven Years in Tibet featuring Brad Pitt was filmed in Uspallata! The nearby Andes Mountains served as a backdrop to mimic the Himalayas. 

Once we arrived in Uspallata, we had some free time to walk around. The tour had started very early so we were desperate for breakfast, and went in search of coffee and a quick bite. 

We made a beeline for Casita Suiza, where you can get tea, coffee, medialunas, alfajores, cakes and sandwiches - something to keep us going until lunchtime!

Others enjoyed a little stroll through town, but it was still quite early in the day so not many businesses were open.

From Uspallata, we drove another hour along Route 7 enjoying dramatic mountain landscapes and passing through small villages, hamlets, and Los Penitentes ski resort before reaching our next stop: the Inca Bridge.

Puente del Inca

Puente del Inca, or the Inca’s Bridge, is a natural rock formation across the Cuevas River, a tributary of the Mendoza River. It is located about 180 kilometres from Mendoza.

What's unique about the arch known as Puente del Inca are its vibrant colours. The water that flows from the hot springs is rich in minerals, which cause the yellow, orange, and red hues. Anything the water touches eventually becomes crystallized.

Fun fact: During his 1835 trip to South America, Charles Darwin visited Puente del Inca where he made drawings of the bridge and its large stalactites.

This unique spot gets its name from Inca legends, though it was also historically used for its nearby hot springs. 

During the early 20th century, a thermal resort and monastery operated the hot springs to treat certain illnesses. Tourists arrived at the resort via Ferrocarril Trasandino Los Andes, a train that continued into Chile through a long tunnel under the Andes. 

The railway station is still standing, though long abandoned. Meanwhile, remnants of an old thermal hotel can still be seen near the site, which was sadly destroyed by a landslide leaving only a chapel standing.

While the thermal resort at Puente del Inca is long gone, there is another thermal spa further down the river called Termas Cacheuta which is quite popular.

Aconcagua Lookout Point

We then stopped at the Aconcagua Lookout Point right along Route 7. On a clear day, you can see the peak of the highest point in the Americas standing 6,960.8 meters high, and we got pretty lucky with the weather that day!

For any of you visiting by car with a bit more time, the entrance to Aconcagua Provincial Park is right next to the Aconcagua Lookout Point, and there are multiple trails should you be in the mood for some trekking.

While serious mountaineers enter the Aconcagua Provincial Park for multi-day treks, most day-trippers settle for the Horcones Lagoon circuit, which offers scenic photo spots. You can view a list of the trails at Aconcagua Provincial Park here.

Our tour just stopped for photos, but this is a place where the mountains beckon, so maybe give yourself more time!

⛰️ If you're not an avid mountaineer but want to hike in Aconcagua Provincial Park, you can book this Full-Day Aconcagua Experience which includes a 1-hour hike. You also get to visit the Potrerillos Dam and Puente del Inca.

Christ Redeemer of the Andes

Of course, no Mendoza Andes day tour would be complete without visiting Christ Redeemer of the Andes, which sits on the border between Chile and Argentina.

The statue stands at a dizzying altitude of 3,832 meters above sea level. It is reached via a very winding road that zigzags its way up the mountain.

Christ the Redeemer of the Andes is a statue symbolizing peace and the historic friendship treaty between the two nations.

At the foot of the sculpture, there is an inscription that reads:

""Sooner shall these mountains crumble into dust than Chileans and Argentines break the peace which at the feet of Christ, the Redeemer, they have sworn to maintain.""

Inaugurated in 1904, the 7-meter bronze statue stands as a reminder of a boundary agreement that avoided conflict between the two countries. It is situated on the pass of Cumbre del Bermejo, where José de San Martín crossed the Andes in 1817 to liberate Chile from Spanish colonial rule.

On clear days, you can enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding Andean peaks and valleys.

It's important to note that the road up to Christ the Redeemer of the Andes is only accessible during the summer months when there is no snow. Winter temperatures can reach -30 °C and the amount of snow makes it impossible to circulate.

There were a few stands selling aguardiente at the top of the mountain. This is a hard liquor which we were told was a good idea if you're feeling cold or lightheaded from the altitude!

My final tip is to dress in layers and pack a windbreaker for the High Andes portion of this tour as the wind up there blows hard! The weather will be completely different from Mendoza City.

Las Cuevas

After visiting Christ Redeemer of the Andes, we started our descent to the town of Las Cuevas.

This is where we had a lunch stop. Lunch is not included in this Mendoza Andes tour, so you either have to pack your own, or you can eat at one of the few restaurants in the village. Meals are simple and quick. We got some empanadas and some French fries since none of us had a big appetite at that altitude.

Las Cuevas is the last Argentine town before reaching the Chilean border, situated at around 3,200 meters above sea level. It’s a small settlement with a handful of quaint buildings and a sense of isolation, surrounded by soaring peaks and snow-capped ridges. Historically, it served as a stopover for travellers crossing the old Trans-Andean Railway.

This was the final stop of our High Mountain tour, so this is where we did a U-turn and started the 3-hour drive back to Mendoza. However, if you're road-tripping on your own and you're continuing onwards to Chile, you would cross at this point via the Cristo Redentor Tunnel.

Is the Mendoza Andes Day Tour worth doing?

If you're looking for a different Mendoza tour, one that isn't focused on wineries and vineyards, and brings you into the High Andes, then this tour fits the bill. You'll get to see the highlights west of Mendoza and go as far as the Argentina-Chile border.

Keep in mind that there are a few different ways to visit these landmarks. You can either book a group excursion, hire a private driver, or rent a car and visit these attractions independently. 

The thing to keep in mind with group tours is that there's a schedule to keep. You'll get to see everywhere, but you won't linger anywhere. We got around 20 minutes at each stop, which was enough time to snap a few photos and have a look around, but it's very different from the independent style of travel that we're used to. 

I would say the tour is worth it if you really want to see places like the Potrerillos Dam, the Inca's Bridge and Christ the Redeemer of the Andes. However, I think it would have been an even better experience if we had rented a car and done things at our own pace, which is much slower! We did this tour in early autumn when the weather in Mendoza was quite mild. 

All that being said, the Andes High Mountain tour has a 4.7/5 rating, is recommended by 94% of travellers, and it's one of the more popular tours from Mendoza. So to each their own!

You also need to consider how many days you have in Mendoza and what experiences you'd like to prioritize. Are you looking for a remote estancia stay where your days are filled with horse treks? Do you want to stay at a wine hotel and visit neighbouring vineyards and wineries? Or do you want an action-packed schedule where you get to explore a different corner of Mendoza each day? The choice is yours.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,8082bd77bb9c1d960bb06423fa4810759e131667

About Monserrat Buenos Aires

Monserrat is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and its origins can be traced back to the city's second founding in 1580.

That's right, Buenos Aires was founded and destroyed multiple times! It was first founded in 1536, then destroyed in 1541, and founded again in 1580 when Juan de Garay disembarked on the shores of Río de la Plata.

This means there's a lot of history to uncover in Monserrat and many of Buenos Aires' main attractions can be found in this very neighbourhood!

Monserrat Neighbourhood Guide

Monserrat, sometimes also written as Montserrat, is flanked by the neighbourhoods of Puerto Madero to the east, San Telmo and Constitucion to the south, Balvanera to the west, and San Nicolas to the north.

This Buenos Aires neighbourhood got its name in 1769 after the construction of the Parish of Our Lady of Monserrat.

In this Monserrat neighbourhood guide, we're going to cover some of the various tours, sights and attractions that you can enjoy in the area. 

Things to do in Monserrat, Buenos Aires

1. Palacio Barolo

Palacio Barolo is one of Buenos Aires' most iconic and architecturally fascinating buildings. It was the tallest building in South America upon its completion in 1923 and remains a prominent landmark in the city’s skyline.

Located on Avenida de Mayo, this skyscraper blends neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau styles with symbolic elements inspired by Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy.

This is an attraction that I had walked past countless times, but I finally decided to take the guided tour during my most recent visit to Buenos Aires. I mean, sure the building is beautiful from the outside, but you need to see it from the inside to understand its connection to Dante's Divine Comedy.

The construction of Palacio Barolo was commissioned by Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant and wealthy businessman, as a testament to his admiration for Dante. He in turn hired Mario Palanti, an Italian architect to bring his vision to life. 

The building is divided into three distinct sections that correspond to the three parts of the poem: Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. The basement and ground floor represent Hell, the middle floors symbolize Purgatory, and the top floors, crowned by a lighthouse, signify Heaven.

We enjoyed doing the Palacio Barolo guided tour, not just for the architecture but also for the views you get from the palace.

At first, we were a bit concerned about how demanding it would be - elevators take you to a certain point, but the final ascent requires climbing 160 steps! Also, the narrowest point of the staircase is 48 centimetres or 18 inches wide, so it does feel like a bit of a squeeze!

However, the reward is getting to see an iconic postcard view of the National Congress of Argentina, plus other famous landmarks. If you happen to visit on a clear day, you can even see as far as Uruguay across the Río de la Plata.

2. Tango Show at La Ventana

Another activity that couldn't be missing in this Monserrat neighbourhood guide is attending a tango show!

Tango is a dance that originated in the 1880s along the River Plate in both Buenos Aires and Montevideo. It was considered a very risqué dance at the time and something that was only seen in the working-class slums that housed many of the newly arrived European immigrants.

La Ventana Barrio de Tango is one of the more popular tango venues in the neighbourhood. It is set in a former conventillo, also known as a tenement which has been completely restored. 

The nice thing about this particular show is that it combines a live tango orchestra and an Argentine gaucho band. That means that aside from watching dancers grace the stage to dance tango, you can also watch a more traditional folklore dance.

When it comes to booking this experience, you can opt for just the show or the dinner and show. The dinner is a 3-course meal featuring an entree, main dish and dessert. 

💃 This tango show at La Ventana gives you the option of booking a 3-course dinner or attending the show only.

This list of the top tango shows in Buenos Aires may also be of interest. 

3. Plaza de Mayo

Plaza de Mayo is one of Argentina's most historically significant squares. It was established in 1580 and has been at the epicentre of political and social life for over four centuries - that means protests, revolutions, and celebrations!

The square is named after the May Revolution of 1810, which marked the beginning of Argentina's path to independence from Spain.

In the centre of the square, you'll find the May Pyramid or Pirámide de Mayo, which was erected in 1811. This obelisk commemorates the first anniversary of the May Revolution and it's the oldest national monument in Buenos Aires.

Plaza de Mayo is surrounded by numerous attractions, so it's a good place to begin your tour of Buenos Aires. 

If you time your visit just right, you can catch the Changing of the Guard. You'll get to see the grenadiers march from Casa Rosada to the Cathedral, where they'll relieve the guard at the mausoleum of General Don José de San Martín. The changing of the guard takes place from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm every 2 hours.

4. Casa Rosada

Casa Rosada, or the Pink House, is the executive mansion and office of the President of Argentina. Also known as the Government House or Casa de Gobierno, this building sits on the east end of the Plaza de Mayo. 

The Casa Rosada is known for its Italianate architecture and unique pink colour. ""Why pink?"", you might ask.

Well, the building's hue is said to be a combination of red and white, representing the colours of the opposing political factions in 19th-century Argentina; the Federals used red while the Unitarians used white.

Another explanation you might hear is that at one point the Pink House was painted with cows' blood, a supposed alternative to paint that wouldn't peel in the humidity!

The interior of the Casa Rosada is just as impressive, featuring grand halls, beautiful staircases, and historic rooms like the Salón de los Bustos, where busts of former presidents are displayed. 

The building also has a stunning courtyard known as the Patio de las Palmeras, filled with palm trees and statues.

Note: Casa Rosada is not currently open to visitors (only guided school visits). When it does re-open to the general public, you'll be able to click through Visitas Casa Rosada. They typically offer free guided tours in both English and Spanish. You will need your passport to enter. 

5. Museo Casa Rosada

Museo Casa Rosada, or the Pink House Museum, is located underneath the presidential palace. In fact, it is set in the same place where the original fort of Buenos Aires and later the Taylor Customs Office once stood.

Visiting this museum feels like taking a step back in time because the old foundations that lay hidden underneath Casa Rosada had to be excavated in order to create this place. 

The museum essentially sits underground and features original exposed brick walls, vaulted galleries, and a glass ceiling that lets in lots of natural light.

Museo Casa Rosada covers some 200 years of history since the May Revolution of 1810 to the present day focusing on Argentina's presidential history. 

The exhibits feature artifacts that would have belonged to former presidents, including official documents, presidential sashes, medals, portraits, cars, and carriages.

We ended up visiting this museum as a fun rainy day activity in Buenos Aires. After walking past the Casa Rosada so many times during almost every visit to Buenos Aires, it was a pleasant surprise to go into the museum and learn a bit more about the country's early history.

6. Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral

The Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral is the main seat of the Catholic Church in Argentina and the seat of the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. 

Located on the northwest end of Plaza de Mayo, this grand cathedral is a cornerstone of the city’s religious and historical heritage. 

The cathedral’s origins date back to the late 16th century, shortly after the founding of Buenos Aires. It underwent several reconstructions due to damage and architectural changes, with its current neoclassical facade completed in the mid-19th century.

The cathedral's design reflects a mix of architectural styles. The facade, designed by French architects Próspero Catelin and Pierre Benoit, features a neoclassical portico with twelve columns representing the apostles. The interior, however, retains its colonial-Baroque roots with a series of ornate chapels and a tiled floor inspired by the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel!

The cathedral houses the mausoleum of General José de San Martín, the revered liberator of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. His tomb is guarded by statues representing the countries he helped liberate, and it's a site of great national pride and reverence.

The cathedral gained international attention when Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, became Pope Francis in 2013. He served as the archbishop here for many years.

7. Cabildo

Officially known as the Museo Histórico Nacional del Cabildo y la Revolución de Mayo, the Cabildo is a historic museum on the west end of Plaza de Mayo.

The building served as the seat of the town council during Spanish colonial rule and it was here that the first steps toward Argentine independence were taken.

The Cabildo played a pivotal role during the May Revolution, where meetings and deliberations were held that ultimately led to the establishment of the first Argentine government independent of Spain.

This museum is free to visit and its collection includes original documents, paintings, and artifacts that range from the colonial period to the early 19th century. These exhibits key in on the social, political, and cultural life of Buenos Aires during the transition from a Spanish colony to an independent nation.

Visitors can explore items related to the May Revolution, such as weapons, uniforms, and personal belongings of revolutionary leaders. 

The building is an important example of colonial architecture in Buenos Aires featuring white walls, arched galleries, and a distinctive bell tower. Although it has undergone several modifications, it still retains much of its original 18th-century charm.

The Cabildo is a National Historic Monument and it's well worth a visit if you find yourself in the area. 

8. National Congress of Argentina

The National Congress of Argentina, or Congreso de la Nación Argentina, is the legislative branch of the Argentine government. 

This imposing neoclassical building is a symbol of the country's democratic processes and political history. It serves as the meeting place for the two chambers of Congress: the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.

The building was designed by architect Víctor Meano and inaugurated in 1906. Its style is inspired by classical Greek and Roman architecture featuring grand columns, a massive dome, and intricate marble interiors. 

The dome, which stands over 80 meters high, is one of the most recognizable features of Buenos Aires' skyline and is topped by a bronze sculpture symbolizing the Republic.

The interior of the Congress building is adorned with marble staircases, stained glass windows, and ornate sculptures. 

The National Congress offers free guided tours that provide insight into the history, architecture, and legislative process. You'll need to bring your passport in order to enter.

9. Block of Enlightenment

The Block of Enlightenment, or Manzana de las Luces in Spanish, is one of Buenos Aires' most historically and culturally significant areas. 

Located in the Monserrat neighbourhood just one block diagonally southwest from Plaza de Mayo, this area is known for its history as an education hub during the colonial and early post-colonial periods.

The block dates back to the 17th century and was originally the site of several important institutions, including the Jesuit Church, the first university of Buenos Aires, the country's first printing press and newspaper, and a series of educational and religious buildings. This was a center for learning and intellectual development which is how it earned its name as the Block of Enlightenment.

One of the most intriguing aspects of Manzana de las Luces is its network of underground tunnels. These tunnels, built by the Jesuits in the 18th century, were used for various purposes, including defence and escape routes. Visitors can explore parts of this labyrinth, which adds an element of mystery to the historical site!

10. San Ignacio de Loyola

San Ignacio de Loyola, or Saint Ignatius Church, forms part of the Block of Enlightenment and it's the oldest existing church in Buenos Aires!

This is a church that was built very gradually with numerous additions. The very first church was built by the Society of Jesus in 1675 and it was made of adobe. 

Then came the addition of the present facade and the southern tower in 1686. The rest of the church's construction was completed between 1712 and 1722, finally ending with its consecration in 1734.

They offer guided visits to the cloisters, Jesuit tunnels and the towers, though you need to purchase your ticket in advance. 

11. Tomb of Manuel Belgrano at Santo Domingo Convent

The Tomb of Manuel Belgrano is located at the Convento de Santo Domingo, a historic convent and church in Monserrat, Buenos Aires. 

This site is significant not only for its religious heritage but also as the final resting place of one of Argentina's most revered national heroes, Manuel Belgrano, the creator of the Argentine flag and a key figure in the country's struggle for independence.

Belgrano was a prominent military leader, lawyer, and economist who played a crucial role in Argentina’s independence movement. He is best known for leading the Northern Army during the Argentine War of Independence and for designing the national flag in 1812.

The convent, built in the late 18th century, was a central location during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. It sustained significant damage during the invasions, but it was restored and has since become a symbol of resilience and national pride.

The tomb, located outside the main entrance of the convent, was constructed in 1903 to honour Belgrano’s legacy. It features a marble mausoleum designed by the Italian sculptor Ettore Ximenes. The monument is adorned with symbolic reliefs and sculptures representing Belgrano’s contributions to the nation.

Where to Shop in Monserrat

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Aux Charpentiers (@auxcharpentiers1888)

Aux Charpentiers

Aux Charpentiers is a historic supply store in Buenos Aires that dates back to 1888. They sell traditional Argentine work clothes, riding clothes and gaucho clothes.

If you're looking to pick up some traditional clothing items like bombachas (gaucho pants) or boinas (gaucho hats), this would be the place to visit! 

I happen to think that boinas make for a great traditional Argentine souvenir - there are so many styles and colours to choose from and some are even embroidered, so you can find some truly unique pieces.

Seeing as this is an older and more traditional store, shopping here is a little bit different as everything is on display behind the counter. It's good to have an idea of the item you're looking for, and then you can ask the shop assistant for help when it comes to pulling different colours and sizes. 

Yes, this is very different from shopping in North America, where you grab the item you want, pay for it and go. Things are a bit more involved here and take more time, but you'll also get the help you need to find a piece that fits just right.

Librería Ávila (Librería del Colegio)

Another cool shop to visit in Monserrat is Librería Ávila, a bookstore that dates back to 1785 making it the oldest in the city of Buenos Aires!

Librería Avila is also known by its former name, Librería del Colegio since for several decades it supplied books to the local students across the street at Real Colegio de San Carlos and later Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires.

This bookstore also played an important role in the May Revolution of 1810 which ultimately gave Argentina its freedom from Spain. It was here that future leaders gathered looking for newly arrived books from France with thoughts and ideas about the French Revolution.

At Libreria Ávila you can peruse both new and used books, however, they specialize in out-of-print and rare books. So if you're searching for something in particular, chat with the staff as they're a wealth of knowledge.

Where to Eat in Monserrat

Bar El Colonial

One of the many things I love about Buenos Aires are its bares notables. These are historic bars, billiard clubs or cafeterias that are somehow related to significant cultural events or activities that took place in the city and are recognized as a Cultural Heritage of the City of Buenos Aires.

Bar El Colonial is one such establishment. Part of this building dates back to the colonial era with kiln-dried mud and straw bricks. The cafe is located just one block from the Block of Enlightenment and directly across from the iconic Otto Wolf Building.

This is the type of place you'd come to have a cafe con leche with a side of medialunas for breakfast. 

They're also well known for their salami or jamón crudo sandwiches if you're looking for a quick and easy lunch.

Like most Buenos Aires cafes, it's a fun spot for people-watching!

D'Oro Italian Bar is an Italian restaurant and wine bar specializing in all things pasta!

To be honest, everything on their menu sounds absolutely mouthwatering: spaghetti with pesto and brie, sweet potato gnocchi with mushrooms in an orange cream sauce, and ravioli stuffed with beef tenderloin in a Malbec sauce!

Plus, they also have risotto, meat and seafood dishes like any good Italian restaurant does. 

Their dessert menu features classics like tiramisu, panna cotta with pistachios and a chocolate volcano cake with mascarpone.

Dome Roof Top Bar

For cocktails with a sunset view of Buenos Aires, you can't go wrong with Dome Roof Top Bar. This bar is located in the sixth floor of the Tango de Mayo Hotel overlooking Avenida de Mayo. 

This is considered one of the best rooftops in Buenos Aires thanks to the city views of Palacio Barolo as well as numerous domes and Parisian-style architecture.

Their cocktail menu features lots of Argentine favourites like fernet con coca, cinzano con soda, and wiscola. Plus, they also have a decent selection of red, white and sparkling wines. 

As for food, their menu is tapas style featuring lots of appetizers, charcuterie boards and finger food perfect for sharing.

Other Neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires

Now that you know what to expect from Monserrat, you can decide if it's the right neighbourhood for you. If you're looking for something a bit different, you may want to consider some of the following neighbourhoods:

San Telmo – Think cobblestones, antique shops, and tango echoing through the streets. This is old-school Buenos Aires and it's ideal for history lovers, vintage treasure hunters, and anyone who swoons over a bit of bohemian charm.

Recoleta - Elegant, leafy, and a little bit Parisian, Recoleta is where Buenos Aires shows off its refined side. Think Belle Époque mansions, grand avenues, world-class museums, one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world, and café terraces made for lingering. We cover everything to see, eat and do in this Recoleta neighbourhood guide.

Puerto Madero – All glass towers and glossy boardwalks, Puerto Madero is Buenos Aires sleek, modern face. Come here for riverside strolls, fancy dinners, and a polished vibe that feels a world away from the city’s hustle.

Retiro – Grand architecture meets urban energy. Retiro is a stylish launch pad, perfect for travellers who want to be close to everything while soaking up a touch of old-world elegance.

Palermo – Trendy cafés, leafy parks and buzzing nightlife. Palermo is the cool kid of Buenos Aires. It’s made for foodies, creatives, and anyone who loves hopping from brunch to boutique to bar without skipping a beat.

La Boca – Bursting with colour, music, and fútbol passion, La Boca is pure personality. I always say this is a better place to visit in the daytime than to stay overnight, as it can be a little rough if you wander a couple of blocks in the wrong direction.

Chacarita – A little under the radar but full of character, Chacarita is where the creative crowd hangs out. Think craft beer, cool cafés, and local life at a slower pace. Great if you love discovering places before they’re cool.

Villa Crespo – This is Palermo’s effortlessly cool neighbour, a little less polished and more authentic. It’s for travellers who love a good hidden gem, whether that’s a tucked-away bakery, vintage shop, or hole-in-the-wall restaurant.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,2d3dfbf8354fe337039d99e388e41e7104eec02b

Well, you've come to the right place!

Today, we're sharing a self-guided itinerary for Northern Patagonia that stretches 500 kilometres and can be done from north to south by flying into Bariloche, or from south to north by flying into Esquel.

We'll be covering the destinations from south to north in this blog post, but you can reverse the route if that works better with your travel plans.

This itinerary features some of the best destinations in Northern Patagonia and includes a nice mix of cities, towns and villages surrounded by pristine nature in the heart of the Argentine Lake District.

But it's not all national parks and hiking; this part of Argentina is also known for craft breweries, wineries, Welsh tea houses, sculpture forests, farms and some pretty amazing natural wonders.

This Northern Patagonia travel itinerary offers something for everyone, so feel free to pick and choose or do it all. The choice is yours!

And if you're planning an even bigger trip, you can also check out our coastal Patagonia road trip itinerary.

Northern Patagonia Travel Itinerary

Esquel

4 days

We're kicking off this Northern Patagonia travel itinerary by flying into Esquel, a mountainside town that offers plenty of trekking options as well as easy access to a national park.

Esquel has a very laidback feel and it is a town without street lights; we were surprised that vehicles here stop for pedestrians, which is quite rare in Argentina!

Things to do in Esquel

Ride the Old Patagonian Express

No visit to Esquel would be complete without riding aboard the Old Patagonian Express, locally known as La Trochita!

This train journey rose to fame when Paul Theroux published his book The Old Patagonian Express in 1978. In it he recounted his travels from his hometown in Massachusetts all the way down to Argentina, and clearly the Patagonia leg of his journey made quite the impression on him!

Today, La Trochita may only operate a short portion of the original 402-kilometre route it once covered, however, it captures the nostalgia of 20th-century train travel.

Travellers can enjoy 3 different segments of the original journey, however, the one from Esquel to Nahuel Pan is our personal favourite!

As you leave Esquel, you begin the ascent out of the valley where you are treated to mountain views and sheep grazing in the Patagonian steppe.

The 1-hour journey is incredibly scenic, and upon arriving in Nahuel Pan there's an artesanal fair where you can buy all sorts of souvenirs (including Welsh-inspired alfajores!), you can enjoy a choripán for lunch, and visit the Museum of Patagonian Culture.

This can be done as a half-day trip from Esquel (the train departs in the morning), and then you still have the afternoon to explore around town.

Laguna La Zeta

If you're looking for a relaxing way to spend the afternoon - perhaps after travelling aboard the Old Patagonian Express in the morning! - then consider Laguna La Zeta, a natural urban reserve in the outskirts of town.

The lagoon gets its name from the Z-shaped trail that zig-zags its way up the mountain. Laguna La Zeta can be reached by car (10 minutes) or on foot (1 hour).

Once you reach the lagoon you'll notice kayak and canoe rentals, as well as horseback riding excursions.

Most people come up for a picnic and to enjoy the surrounding scenery.

Cerro La Cruz

Esquel offers a fair bit of hiking and Cerro La Cruz is one of the many trails you can enjoy.

This hike takes about 1.5 hours each way, is medium level difficulty, and reaches a maximum altitude of 1,050 metres.

There are two main access points for anyone wanting to hike Cerro de la Cruz; you can go via Barrio Baden on the east end of town or Barrio Ceferino on the west.

Yes, it's steep the whole way, however, you efforts are rewarded with panoramic views.

You can read our complete travel guide to Esquel for more ideas of things to do in town and nearby.

Day trips from Esquel

Los Alerces National Park

This park sits in the Andes Mountains of Northern Patagonia and it borders Chile. It consists of Valdivian forest and is home to hanging glaciers, snowcapped mountains, alpine meadows, and lakes and rivers that shift from turquoise to emerald.

One of the main draws to Los Alerces National Park is the forest with millenary alerce trees, including one specimen that is 2,700 years old. Reaching it involves a hike to Puerto Chucao, followed by a boat trip on Lake Menendez. Plus you even get to see the hanging Torrecillas Glacier along the way!

Other activities you can enjoy in the park include a trek to the base of the Torrecillas Glacier, kayaking excursions, and of course hiking the many trails.

Piedra Parada

Piedra Parada translates to ‘standing rock’ and it is a giant rock that rises 240 metres from the middle of the Patagonian steppe.

Its origins are volcanic and once upon a time this area would have been the caldera of an ancient mega volcano.

Aside from the giant monolith, another impressive landmark is Cañón de la Buitrera, or the Vulture's Canyon.

The canyon stretches 8 kilometres with a 3-kilometre walking trail, and the walls stand around 150 meters high. This is a popular rock climbing spot.

Along the canyon, you can visit the aleros, which are small refuges in the rock, almost like caves. These would have been used by the pre-Tehuelches and Tehuelches who inhabited this area in a seasonal manner up to 5000 years ago.

Piedra Parada can be visited from Esquel independently or as part of a guided tour.

The next stop on our Northern Patagonia travel itinerary is Trevelin. This is one of the many Welsh towns you'll find sprinkled across Patagonia. Its name translates to 'mill town' in Welsh, named so after the first flour mill which was established in 1891.

The town sits on the edge of the Percy River and boasts beautiful mountain views to the west.

It's an ideal destination to come and enjoy a few days of relaxation and good wine!

Things to do in Trevelin

Trevelin Wineries

Trevelin has a fairly new but blossoming wine scene offering a mix of wine tastings, in house restaurants and winery accommodations.

White wines do very well in this climate, so you can expect to sample Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. And as far as red grapes, it's all about the Pinot Noir around these parts.

Some of the wineries you can visit in Trevelin include:

Viñas del Nant y Fall

Contra Corriente

Casa Yagüe

Tulip Farm

Depending on the time of year you visit Trevelin, you may be able to see the beautiful tulip fields the town is famous for.

Aside from visiting the tulip fields, Tulipanes Patagonia also sells tulip bulbs, plus they have an on-site tea house where you can enjoy a Welsh afternoon tea.

October is the month to visit with visitors coming from far and wide.

Nant Fach Mill

The Nant Fach Mill is located about 17 kilometres outside of Trevelin and it's a replica of the flour mills used in the late nineteenth century.

Its name Nant Fach translates to 'small creek' from Welsh.

The mill acts as a museum with lots of agricultural machinery on display around the garden, and an indoor museum featuring tools, furniture, crockery and musical instruments brought over by the Welsh.

Nant y Fall Waterfall

Another thing to do in the outskirts of Trevelin is hike to the waterfalls.

Nant y Fall is a natural protected area where you can see three main waterfalls: La Petisa or 'the short one', Las Mellizas or 'the twins', and El Salto Grande or 'the big jump' which is 64 meters high.

It's a 4-kilometre walk from the main road Ruta Nacional 259.

Andes Mill Museum

The Andes Mill Museum in Trevelin is not to be missed!

If you want to learn why there are so many Welsh communities scattered all over Patagonia, this museum is a good place to start.

The museum is divided into different galleries that document the arrival of the Welsh settlers and their relationship with the indigenous peoples, the everyday items they brought over from Europe, and the tools and machinery they would have used once they started their lives as farmers in Patagonia.

Welsh Afternoon Tea

Another thing to do in Trevelin is to enjoy a Welsh afternoon tea. After all, this town was founded by Welsh immigrants!

The two main tea houses in Trevelin are:

Nain Maggie Teahouse

Casa de Té La Mutisia

We've eaten at both and they each have their own feel. Nain Maggie felt very casual and cozy and they had an impressive selection of cakes - we were obsessed with their chocolate sponge cake with coffee icing!

Casa de Té La Mutisia felt slightly fancier and it had some historical displays.

El Bolsón

4 days

El Bolsón is a hippie town with epic views carved out between two mountain ranges.

This a destination in the Andean Region of the 42nd Parallel where nature abounds and each day of your visit can be spent chasing waterfalls, going to the lake, or tackling yet another breathtaking hike.

El Bolsón also has lots of craft breweries, ice cream shops and restaurants, so in between all the hiking and outdoor fun, you can eat very well!

It's a destination you won't want to miss on your Northern Patagonia travels.

Things to do in El Bolsón

Bosque Tallado

One of the most unique attractions in El Bolsón is the Bosque Tallado or the Carved Forest located on Cerro Piltriquitrón at 1,420 meters above sea level.

This sculpture forest came about after a series of fires burnt down much of the mountainside.

Local artist Marcelo López came up with the idea of inviting artists to breathe new life into the forest through art. The idea: each artist would create a sculpture using the burnt and fallen lenga trees in the forest.

Gatherings were organized in 1998, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2014, adding new sculptures to the forest.

It's a beautiful hike, and aside from the artwork, the mountain views are pretty spectacular!

Hippie Fair

El Bolsón is well known for its artisan fair that sets up in Plaza Pagano every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

There are around 200 stalls selling ceramics, leather, tapestries, candles, honey, jams and even natural cosmetics. Plus, we can't forget all the food trucks where you can sample empanadas, choripán, crêpes, hamburgers and more.

It's a great spot to do a bit of souvenir and gift shopping.

Hiking in El Bolsón

El Bolsón is a great hiking destination and there are numerous trails to choose from all ranging in length and level of difficulty. A few to consider include:

Cerro Amigo - Easy hike with 3 lookouts offering town and mountain views (2 kms, 30 mins)

Cerro Piltriquitrón - The most iconic mountain whose name means 'hanging from the clouds' and leads to a refuge (9.3 kms, 5 h)

Cabeza del Indio - Leads to a lookout of the valley and there's a rock that resembles a human head (6.8 kms, 2 h 15 mins)

El Cajón del Azul - This trails starts at the Wharton Farm and leads to a river canyon (17.4 kms, 5 h 45 mins)

Distances and trekking times are there and back. You can find a complete list of hiking trails in and around El Bolsón here.

Day trips from El Bolsón

Lago Puelo

Lago Puelo or Lake Puelo is another spot not to be missed on your Northern Patagonia travel itinerary!

This lake is situated in Lago Puelo National Park in the northern end of the Chubut Province and it is home to Valdivian forest, mountain peaks, and beautiful hiking trails including one that leads to the Chilean border.

Lago Puelo's waters are deep blue and they get their colour from the glacier sediment found in the rivers that feed the lake.

This is a really nice place to spend the day; you can enjoy a dip in the lake, have a picnic lunch (sometimes there are food trucks!), and if you want to tackle an easy hike that offers panoramic views, you can't go wrong with Mirador del Lago.

Butch Cassidy's Ranch in Cholila

Did you know that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid owned a ranch in Patagonia?

Yes, we're talking about the infamous American train and bank robbers from the days of the Wild West.

After law enforcement got hot on their trail, the two escaped to Argentina along with the Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place.

After arriving in Buenos Aires on a steamer using fake identities, they made their way even further south to Patagonia. Here they purchased land, bought cattle, and set up shop in a four-room cabin.

Today their cabin has been restored and it is open to visitors. Though keep in mind it is free of furnishings, so you are going to look at an empty log cabin!

There's also a museum on site called Museo Bar: La Legal, which also acts as a cafe and bar. It's a cool spot in this relatively rural and desolate area.

The ranch is a 1-hour drive south of El Bolsón, just 10 kilometres before you reach the town of Cholila.

El Hoyo

The town of El Hoyo is home to Laberinto Patagonia, which is the largest labyrinth in South America!

Nestled in a 5-hectare estate, the labyrinth has 2,200 metres worth of paths and is a fun activity whether you’re visiting as a couple, with family or friends.

The views when you emerge from the labyrinth are pretty epic - you can see the whole valley and mountains on either side!

The labyrinth also has a tea house on site and they serve the most delectable cake; you absolutely must order their chocolate cake with blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, gooseberries, strawberries and whipped cream.

El Hoyo also has a few wineries and vineyards if you'd like to add wine tasting to your visit:

Patagonian Wines

Bodega y Viñedos Ayestarán Allard

Mammarelli Wines

Bariloche

4 days

San Carlos de Bariloche, more commonly known as Bariloche, is the biggest city we're covering on this Northern Patagonia travel itinerary yet it still manages to have that easygoing feel you'd expect from a Patagonian town.

The nice thing about staying in Bariloche is that you're surrounded by lakes and mountains in all directions.

It is a nature lover's paradise where you can enjoy hiking, boating, brewery-hopping and lots of light adventure! 

There are also some really interesting walking tours in Bariloche if you want to dive deeper into the city's history.

Things to do in Bariloche

Isla Victoria

The most popular activity you can do in Bariloche is go on a boat tour of Isla Victoria and the Arrayanes Forest.

This excursion departs from Puerto Pañuelo and journeys through the waters of Lago Nahuel Huapi towards the Quetrihué Peninsula where you visit the Arrayanes Forest.

The boat then continues its journey towards Bahía Anchorena which is located on Isla Victoria. Here you disembark once more and can join a guided hike or explore at your own leisure.

There's also a nice beach called Playa del Toro and while the waters are pretty cold year-round, that doesn't stop people from enjoying a refreshing summer dip!

Circuito Chico

Another must-do Bariloche day tour is to drive the Circuito Chico, literally 'short circuit'. If you're not renting a car, you can do the same trip by bus! It's such a beautiful route that I recommend experiencing it even if you only have 48 hours in Bariloche!

This is a scenic drive that follows the shores of Lago Nahuel Huapi as you leave Bariloche heading northwest, and it then does a loop around various lakes before circling back towards Bariloche.

Along the way, there are lookout points where you can pull over and snap photos. Plus, there are also breweries, restaurants, cafes, hiking trails, kayak rentals, and everything you could possibly want for a beautiful day out in nature.

The drive can typically be done in half a day, including stops for food and photos at various panoramic lookouts. Or you could make it a full-day activity by enjoying some of the tours and activities in the area. You can find my guide to Bariloche's Circuito Chico here.

Cable Car to Cerro Campanario

Cerro Campanario is a mountain peak in Nahuel Huapi National Park that stands 1,058 meters above sea level.

The peak of Cerro Campanario offers 360° views from which you can observe Lago Nahuel Huapi, Lago Moreno, Isla Victoria, Cerro Otto, Cerro López, Cerro Catedral, the Llao Llao Hotel and more

You can hike to the top of Cerro Campanario, however, there are more beautiful hikes in Bariloche, so I would recommend taking the cable car up instead.

Patagonian Breweries

Bariloche is synonymous with craft beer. There are countless breweries to choose from and it would be almost impossible to try them all in one visit, but you can sure try!

Some of the breweries we enjoyed include:

Cervecería Patagonia - the best views! Sip on your beer while enjoying views of lakes and snow-capped mountains.

Cervecería Gilbert - a cozy and rustic brewery that serves up local dishes like deer stew, wild boar and trout.

Cervecería Manush - order a beer flight with one of their mouthwatering gourmet burgers.

Patagonian Chocolate

Another thing you must try in Bariloche is Patagonian chocolate! Just walk down Calle Mitre and you'll be overwhelmed with options.

Mamuschka is a nice spot to stock up on chocolate, or enjoy breakfast or afternoon tea. Because did I mention that aside from chocolates they also serve all sorts of delicious pastries, cakes and specialty coffees? That's right!

For something a little unusual, Rapa Nui features a cafe, an ice cream parlour and a skating rink all under the same roof. Have a dulce de leche ice cream, then go ice skating, and lastly hop over to the cafe to warm up with a cup of coffee and maybe snack on their famous chocolate-covered raspberries.

You can get more ideas of fun things to do in Bariloche here.

Day Trips from Bariloche

Colonia Suiza

A popular day trip from Bariloche is Colonia Suiza, a small village that was founded by early Swiss settlers in Patagonia. It draws a lot of backpackers and campers, as well as nearby day trippers - yes, it's a bit touristy!

Colonia Suiza is the type of place that has the power to transport you back in time with its sleepy dirt roads lined by tall trees. A fun day here includes enjoying some beach time on the shores of Lago Perito Moreno, sipping on craft beers at Berlina, and feasting on German and Swiss dishes at the local restaurants.

If you happen to visit on a Wednesday or Sunday during the tourist season, you can try curanto, a method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in an earth oven. This is a tradition that was brought over from Chiloé, Chile.

Villa La Angostura

2 days

Villa La Angostura is yet another Northern Patagonia destination worth adding to your travel itinerary!

This town is nicknamed 'the Garden of Patagonia' thanks to its rosebush-lined streets, plus its streets are also named after different plants and flowers.

Villa La Angostura is known for its two bays, fly fishing opportunities, and it's also the gateway to the famous Arrayanes Forest said to have inspired Disney's Bambi.

Road of the Seven Lakes

The Road of the Seven Lakes, or La Ruta de Los Siete Lagos in Spanish, is a scenic 107-kilometre drive that stretches from the town of Villa La Angostura in the south to the town of San Martín de Los Andes in the north.

Aside from going past seven lakes, it also crosses 2 national parks, and it's considered one of the most scenic drives in Argentina!

The route can be driven in one day independently or as part of a guided tour. And while it takes just under 2 hours to cover the full distance, this is best done as a full-day activity so that you can enjoy all the scenic stops along the way, and of course, visit all the lakes!

Arrayanes Forest

Set on the Quetrihué Peninsula that juts out from the town of Villa La Angostura, is a forest locally known as Bosque de Arrayanes.

This forest is home to the arrayán tree known for its flakey cinnamon-coloured bark with cream patches. What makes this tree special is that it always feels cool to the touch because its bark is so thin that you can feel the sap flowing!

The trees in the Arrayanes Forest are around 300 years old, though a few are over 650 years of age.

The best way to experience this forest is to go a boat tour to the peninsula which includes a guided walk around the forest, and then rather than getting back on the boat, you can hike the 12 kilometres back to Villa La Angostura.

This is a full-day activity and it's a really nice way to soak in the beauty of Northern Patagonia.

Bahía Mansa and Bahía Brava

Villa La Angostura has two bays: Bahía Mansa, meaning ‘calm bay’, and Bahía Brava, meaning ‘wild bay’.

The two bays are separated by the narrowest point of the Quetrihué Peninsula and are just a 5-minute walk away from each other.

The bays are popular for a cool dip, water activities and enjoying the sunset.

Here's our complete itinerary of things to do in Villa La Angostura during your visit.

San Martín de Los Andes

3 days

San Martín de Los Andes is the next stop on this Northern Patagonia travel itinerary offering plenty of nature and outdoor fun.

This town is surrounded by mountains and also features a lake to the west with beach access and plenty of boating options.

Like most of the destinations we've covered so far, craft breweries, artesanal chocolate shops and restaurants abound, so you can be sure you'll eat well around these parts.

Things to do in San Martín de Los Andes

Lago Lacar Boat Trip

The main thing to do for anyone visiting San Martín de Los Andes is to go on a boat tour of Lago Lacar.

This lake stretches 25 kilometres in length and is neatly tucked into the Andes Mountain range.

Over the course of the tour, you make stops at Quila Quina Beach, where you can grab lunch or enjoy a stroll along the beach; Chachin Waterfall, which can be reached by a dirt trail through the Valdivian forest; Hua Hum, where there's a tea house serving cakes and pastries; and the island of Santa Teresita, where there is a small chapel.

It's a really enjoyable trip and a nice way to experience this part of Patagonia.

Hiking in San Martín de Los Andes

Like most of the destinations covered on this Northern Patagonia travel itinerary, San Martín de Los Andes also offers plenty of hiking opportunities! We mainly enjoyed the lookouts:

Mirador Arrayán - lake and town views from the south side, plus it leads to a tea house! (2.6 kms, 30 mins)

Mirador Bandurrias - moderate hike offering views of Lake Lácar (4.0 kms, 1 h 30 mins)

Casa de Té Arrayán

Another place we enjoyed in San Martín de Los Andes was the Arrayán Tea House, which is located just past Mirador Arrayán.

You can do the hike and then reward yourself with afternoon tea!

The tea house is set in an old log cabin with epic lake views, they offer a variety of loose-leaf teas, and we were pleasantly surprised with their selection of cakes, scones and sandwiches.

It's worth the trek up, for sure.

Here are some more ideas of things to do in San Martín de Los Andes on your visit.

Villa Traful

2 days

The final stop on this Northern Patagonia travel itinerary is Villa Traful, and of course, we chose a scenic out-of-the-way destination to end the trip.

This lakeside destination is all about relaxation and unwinding after a busy few weeks of road-tripping!

Things to do in Villa Traful

Lago Traful

Villa Traful gets its name from Lake Traful and it's the main attraction in town.

Who doesn't want to enjoy lakeside strolls and lakeside views from a cozy cabin on the hillside?

Most of your time here will centre around the lake and the activities it offers.

Submerged Forest

One of the more unusual attractions in Villa Traful is the Submerged Forest, known as Bosque Sumergido in Spanish.

The trees you see rising from the lake once grew on the hillside, but a landslide in the 1960s left them submerged beneath the waters of Lago Traful.

There are about 60 submerged cypress trees in total, and their trunks and branches are visible thanks to the crystal-clear waters.

The Submerged Forest can be visited by boat; excursions depart from the dock on the south side of the lake and travel to the north side where the forest is located.

And if you want to go scuba diving and see the Submerged Forest in all its glory, you can do so too via Buceo VLA.

Waterfall Hikes

Villa Traful offers two different hikes through the Patagonian forest and both hikes lead to waterfalls.

Cascada del Arroyo Coa Co is a 40-minute loop, while Cascada del Arroyo Blanco is a 60-minute loop that also features a small detour to a bird-watching observatory.

Northern Patagonia Travel Tips & Advice

If you're planning to drive this route, note that rental cars in Argentina are almost exclusively standard/manual transmission. Automatic transmission cars are few and far between, and the rental price is typically 3x as much as that of a standard car.

You can do this route by bus, but keep in mind there may not be daily connections, especially to some of the smaller destinations. For example, the bus to Villa Traful only runs twice a week.

December-February is the summer travel season in Argentina, and there's a lot of domestic tourism. If you want to enjoy the peace and solitude of Patagonia, you may want to consider travelling off-peak (September-November is springtime and March-May is autumn).

You can expect to find some English spoken in the cities and bigger towns, but less so in the smaller destinations listed on this itinerary. Though don't let that deter you because locals are friendly and charades can work wonders to get a message across.

That's our complete Northern Patagonia travel itinerary!

As mentioned earlier, this route can be driven from south to north or north to south. It can also be lengthened or shortened by adjusting how many days you spend in each destination, or removing some of the places you don't have enough time for.

Whichever version of this itinerary you decide to follow, we hope you'll have a wonderful time exploring Northern Patagonia!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,9027fd3b0a757943631b4a38c7f85862c6cbf30c

Palacio Barolo is an iconic 100-metre-tall office building that stands along Avenida de Mayo in Buenos Aires. Not only does it offer epic 360-degree views of the city, but it's also a National Historic Monument of Argentina thanks to its architectural design, which pays homage to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.

The building was commissioned by Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who made his wealth in the textile industry, and it was designed by Mario Palanti, an Italian architect known for several famous constructions in both Argentina and Uruguay. In fact, Barolo Palace has a twin in Montevideo, Uruguay known as Palacio Salvo!

The design of Palacio Barolo is eclectic, to say the least; it has Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Gothic elements all rolled into one. But what's unique about the building is the symbolism, which takes visitors through the architect's interpretation of Dante's Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.

Palacio Barolo was completed in 1923, and it was the tallest building not only in Buenos Aires but in all of South America for over a decade until it was overtaken by the Kavanagh Building in 1936.

We had walked past this building countless times during our many visits to Buenos Aires, but we knew the only way to truly appreciate it was by joining one of the guided tours of Palacio Barolo, so we finally did that! This is also a great activity if you have a rainy day in Buenos Aires and are looking for indoor activities.

In this blog post, I'll share what to expect from your visit to Palacio Barolo, how to buy tickets, and whether I think the experience is worth it.

🌟 Visiting Buenos Aires soon? You can book this classic Palacio Barolo guided tour or this nighttime Palacio Barolo tour with wine. 🍷

Palacio Barolo & Dante's Divine Comedy

Palacio Barolo was designed in accordance with Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy (1321), an epic poem that examines the afterlife through a 14th-century Medieval worldview. In this poem, Dante travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.

Along this journey, Dante has 3 guides: Virgil, who represents human reason and guides him for all of Inferno and most of Purgatorio; Beatrice, who represents divine love and theology and leads him from the end of Purgatorio on to Paradise; and Saint Bernard, who represents mystical theology and accompanies him towards the end of his journey in Paradise.

Dante's poem is meant to be interpreted as the soul's journey toward God while exploring different themes like sin, redemption, and divine justice.

Because Palacio Barolo was designed with Dante's cosmology in mind, this means there is plenty of architectural symbolism along the way, which makes for a fun visit!

Palacio Barolo has 22 floors and these are divided into three sections, which we'll explore in more detail. 

Hell

The basement and ground floor of Palacio Barolo represent hell. We didn't visit the basement level since this is off-limits and not included in the guided visit of Palacio Barolo, however, we did get to explore the ground floor in detail.

The ground level features plenty of symbolism and if you look up at the sculptures that adorn the columns, you'll see snakes, dragons and gargoyles.

Underneath the central dome, there's a sculpture of a condor carrying Dante's body to paradise. 

Barolo hoped that Dante's ashes would be housed in Palacio Barolo, as it was an unstable time in Europe, and he feared the ashes could be lost or stolen.

Purgatory

Floors 1-14 of Palacio Barolo represent purgatory. We first rode the elevator up to the 4th floor, stopping at the round internal balcony that looks down to the ground floor.

At this point, the architecture changed with some floral motifs, including hidden mouths, horns and eyes. The idea is that each person will see their own personal demons in these.

We then got back on the elevator and travelled up to the 14th floor, which is the last level of purgatory. At this point, the architecture becomes much more minimalist and a lot more natural light enters the building signalling we are closer to Paradise.

Heaven

Floors 15-22 of Barolo Palace represent heaven, and this is where the real effort begins, as you have to climb the stairs to finally reach paradise.

The way up is a spiralling staircase that gets narrower the closer you get to the top. However, it's worth noting that you have a landing on every floor, so you can stop to rest and catch your breath if you need!

The reward at the end of the climb is a lighthouse that offers 360-degree views of Buenos Aires! The views are truly spectacular; I would say you get the best views of the Palace of the National Congress of Argentina.

We lucked out with good weather and we could actually see as far as Uruguay across the River Plate.

Know Before You Visit Palacio Barolo

You will need to climb 160 steps during your guided tour of Palacio Barolo. This happens towards the end of the tour as you reach the narrowest part of the building. It is the equivalent of 8 flights of stairs, however, there are landings in between each floor so you can stop and catch your breath if need be. 

You must wear comfortable shoes given the amount of stairs to climb. High heels are not allowed. This is because you will be climbing spiralling staircases where part of the steps are narrow. You need comfortable shoes for your safety.

The narrowest point you'll go through while visiting Palacio Barolo is 48 centimetres or 18 inches wide. This will take place during the final 2 floors as you take the spiralling staircase up to the lighthouse. 

It's a good idea to bring a water bottle so you can stay hydrated, especially if you're visiting Palacio Barolo during the summer months. It can get quite warm, especially in the lighthouse, where you have glass windows in all directions.

This tour is not accessible, considering you must be able to climb stairs. Our guide did mention there is a 1-person elevator (typically not available to visitors) that can get you as far as the balconies, where you can enjoy city views, but the only way to reach the lighthouse is on foot.

How to Book a Palacio Barolo Tour

There are a few different ways to book a guided tour of Palacio Barolo. 

In Person

We were already in Buenos Aires and we were staying just a couple of blocks from Palacio Barolo, so we decided to buy our tickets in person. 

Also, because we were travelling during the low season, we weren't too worried about spots completely selling out. 

We arrived at Palacio Barolo an hour before the tour start time, bought our tickets in the lobby and then explored the area until the tour started.

Online

You can book 3 different Palacio Barolo tours on the official Palacio Barolo website which are offered via Los Sombreros Tours. These include daytime tours, nighttime tours and themed tours. However, you'll have to complete the booking in Spanish. While the tour is bilingual, the website is not! 

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to complete the online booking in English, you can book the tour via GetYourGuide. They offer the classic Palacio Barolo guided tour as well as this nighttime Palacio Barolo tour with wine at the end.

Palacio Barolo Rooftop Bar

Another way to enjoy the views from Palacio Barolo is to visit the rooftop bar, Salon 1923. 

This cocktail bar opened its doors in 2019 and is located on Palacio Barolo's 16th floor, which architecturally puts it in the Paradise section of the building.

There are two outdoor spaces: TERRAZZO OBELISCO which faces east and TERRAZZO CONGRESO which faces west and offers some spectacular sunsets. There's also an indoor space called SPAZIO INTERIORE set in the 1920s in terms of its design and music. 

Salon 1923 has set hours, and the menu ranges from tea time to cocktails to tapas. Visitors can enjoy:

Merienda (afternoon tea time) - Friday thru Monday at 17:00 

Cocktail Hour - Wednesdays at 18:30, 20:00 and 21:30

Gourmet Tapas - Thursday thru Monday 19:00 and 21:00

You may want to double-check their hours and menu here as these are subject to change.

Is Palacio Barolo worth visiting?

Prior to visiting, I wondered if the Palacio Barolo tour would be worth it, especially considering I haven't read Dante's Divine Comedy yet. 

Would I be able to appreciate the architectural symbolism? Would climbing all those floors to paradise be worth it? Would it be scary for someone who doesn't love heights?

Now having done the tour, I would say, yes, visiting Palacio Barolo is worth it! I would do it for the views of Congress alone. You also get some epic panoramic views of Buenos Aires' Monserrat neighbourhood and other parts of the city.

Most visitors joining this tour haven't read Dante's Divine Comedy either and the guides do a really good job of summarizing the poem, important themes, and symbols that are present in the building's architecture. We learned lots of cool facts about the building and got to see some Masonic symbols that were hidden in the building's design. It was loaded with lots of fun information.

Climbing the last 8 floors through Paradise and up to the lighthouse was easier than I thought it would be. We took it nice and slow, plus as I mentioned earlier, each floor had a landing where we could stop to catch our breath before continuing upwards. 

As for the scary factor for people who don't love heights, I'll say that I've tackled worse buildings! The staircase spirals around an elevator shaft, so just don't look down that way. Focus on each step or look at the wall on your left. Once you reach the glass lighthouse you can feel a bit exposed (I did!), so I chose to sit on the ground instead of the glass benches.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,3a67eff844a484a6f24d6745160741d2102a68bf

The Comarca Andina is best known for its rugged landscapes with majestic mountains, pristine lakes, and lush forests which draw domestic visitors but are yet undiscovered by international travellers.

This region sits between the provinces of Río Negro and Chubut and is home to some beautiful, underrated destinations that are best explored as part of a Northern Patagonia road trip.

Admittedly, reaching these lesser-known towns first involves getting to Bariloche as this is the gateway, but you can then be on your way exploring dusty trails.

Today, we are sharing 7 underrated places to visit in Patagonia!

Patagonia Off-The-Beaten-Path

What is the Comarca Andina del Paralelo 42?

The Comarca Andina del Paralelo 42, also known as the Andean Region of the 42nd Parallel, is a small geographical region in Northern Patagonia.

It is characterized by its location along the 42nd parallel south latitude, which runs through the Andes mountain range.

The Comarca Andina del Paralelo 42 encompasses several towns and villages, including El Bolsón, El Hoyo, Lago Puelo, Epuyén, El Maitén, El Manso and Cholila.

This Andean region is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers. It offers a wide range of activities such as hiking, trekking, fishing, and horse riding, providing ample opportunities to soak in the tranquillity of the Patagonian wilderness.

Lago Puelo

This scenic mountain town shares the same name as the local lake and the national park. It's a lakeside destination with plenty of hiking trails you can enjoy by day, and breweries where you can unwind by night.

Top attractions in Lago Puelo

Lago Puelo Boat Tour

If you only have time for one activity in Lago Puelo, it needs to be a boat tour through Lago Puelo National Park.

Nautica Puelo is the boat operator that runs tours of Lago Puelo. Their outings range from 40-minute sightseeing trips to longer 2-hour and 45-minute journeys which involve a little bit of hiking and take you to the border with Chile.

If you're pressed for time and only have one day in Lago Puelo, this is a great way to see the beauty of this national park.

Pasarela Río Azul

Pasarela Río Azul is the name of a hanging bridge in the northwest end of Lago Puelo that crosses the Río Azul and offers great hiking opportunities.

Once you cross the bridge, you will see signs that lead to Cascada Motoco Cardenas, a waterfall; and Mirador del Río Blanco, a lookout point where the Río Blanco which runs through a canyon.

During the summer months, you'll find snack stands selling chilled beverages, sandwiches, waffles, empanadas - basically easy-to-go food that you can enjoy during your hike.

Hiking Trails

There are plenty of hiking trails in and around Lake Puelo for those wanting to hike Patagonia off the beaten path.

On the east end of town, you can get on the trail known as Sendero de la Virgen which eventually breaks off in 4 different directions: Virgen del Currumahuida, La Cruz, Camino del Faldeo and Subida La Lidia a Puesto Maninga.

These are just some of the trails around town. Aside from the above, you also have the trail network within Lago Puelo National Park.

Where to stay in Lago Puelo

B&B Casapuelo - cosy bed and breakfast featuring mountain views and free bikes to get around town.

Huala Hosteria - guesthouse set in a large garden with fruit trees and lavender fields. They also serve up a large countryside breakfast.

Linaje Hotel Boutique & Relax - boutique mountainside accommodations set on a ranch with fruit orchards and a swimming pool. This place is located on the outskirts of town so a vehicle is a must!

El Hoyo

For a taste of Patagonia off-the-beaten-track it's worth visiting El Hoyo, a small mountain community that's becoming known as an agrotourism destination thanks to all of its berry farms and vineyards. El Hoyo also offers some nice hiking opportunities and it is home to the largest labyrinth in South America.

Top attractions in El Hoyo

Vineyards and Wineries

Patagonia has a burgeoning wine scene and you can really see this in the town of El Hoyo.

Some vineyards and wineries to visit include:

Mamarelli Wines

Bodega y Viñedos Ayestarán Allard

Bodega y Viñedos Oriundo

Patagonian Wines

We visited Patagonian Wines and opted for a vineyard picnic and wine tasting which was a lot of fun!

Once we arrived at the vineyard, we were presented with a picnic basket that we chose to enjoy out on the picnic tables with views of the mountains, valleys, and surrounding vines.

We sampled 3 different wine varieties and enjoyed them with a charcuterie board featuring smoked trout, wild boar and an assortment of cheeses.

Afterwards, we went on a guided tour of the property and learned about their wine-making process.

Berry Farms

El Hoyo is the 'National Capital of Fine Fruit' and it even hosts the National Fine Fruit Festival every year in January.

This makes it a fun agrotourism destination where you can spend time visiting farms, picking berries, and buying local jams.

LatitudSur Berries is one of the many places you can visit. They offer guided tours and you can walk through their fields of raspberry and blackberry bushes.

Laberinto Patagonia

Laberinto Patagonia is the largest labyrinth in South America!

Tucked away in a 5-hectare estate, this labyrinth has 2,200 metres worth of paths and it offers beautiful views of the whole valley.

It's a fun activity to enjoy and they also have an amazing tea house on site where you can try a delectable chocolate cake loaded with local berries.

Where to stay in El Hoyo

Hosteria El Hoyo - guesthouse with a beautiful garden, mountain views and an on-site restaurant.

Cabanas Mari Mari - accommodation with mountain views, free WiFi and free private parking.

Epuyén

The small mountain village of Epuyén sits on the shores of Lake Epuyén, which is said to be one of the clearest lakes in Argentina with cool crystalline waters. The main attractions here centre around nature and the outdoors and it's very much an underrated place to visit in Patagonia.

Top attractions in Epuyén

Puerto Patriada

Puerto Patriada is the port on the northern tip of Lake Epuyén, which ironically is closer to El Hoyo than it is to Epuyén.

This is a nice place to spend the day; you can either pack a picnic or enjoy one of the many restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops that open their doors during the summer months.

Aside from that, you can also go kayaking, canoeing or stand-up paddle boarding.

There are also hiking trails to enjoy, one of which leads to a beautiful pebbly beach.

Epuyén Stupa

The Epuyén Stupa, also known as Samanthabadra, is the largest and southernmost stupa in Argentina.

This Buddhist monument sits atop a mountain where colourful flags flap in the wind and visitors can enjoy a quiet moment of meditation.

The stupa can be reached on foot; you can view the trail here.

Puerto Bonito Municipal Park

Puerto Bonito Municipal Park sits on the eastern shore of Lake Epuyén right next to the village of Epuyén.

There are a couple of beaches on this end of the lake as well, plus you can visit Centro Cultural Antu Quillen, where you can buy handicrafts made by various local artists.

They also host concerts and other cultural events throughout the year.

Where to stay in Epuyén

La Amarilla - one-bedroom apartment with patio and mountain views.

El Maitén

El Maitén is a small Patagonian town that sits on the shores of the Chubut River surrounded by farms. The town has strong links to the Old Patagonian Express since it was the intermediate point on the railroad tracks between the towns of Ingeniero Jacobacci and Esquel.

Top attractions in El Maitén

Old Patagonian Express

The top attraction in El Maitén is the famous Old Patagonian Express train, locally known as La Trochita.

The most famous route is the one that runs from Esquel to Nahuel Pan, however, if that's too far out of the way, you have the option of riding the lesser-known train from El Maitén to Desvío Bruno Thomaé.

This is a 26-kilometre journey across the Patagonian steppe offering mountain views on the horizon. This leg of the journey is a bit flatter than the Esquel-Nahuel Pan section, however, it's still an enjoyable experience.

You can also cross over to the dining car to enjoy a meal during your journey.

If you do the tour, it’s worth arriving early in order to visit the Railway Museum and the Locomotive Repair Shop.

Where to stay in El Maitén

Accommodation options are very limited in El Maitén, so it might be best to stay in one of the neighbouring towns.

El Manso

El Manso is a small blink-and-you'll-miss-it rural destination quite close to the border with Chile. It's Patagonia off-the-beaten-path and a great place to disconnect and go off-grid. There isn't much here save for a handful of farms, but the river is spectacular and camping is the thing to do.

Top attractions in El Manso

Camping or Glamping

El Manso is best known as a camping destination with multiple campgrounds set up along the shores of the Río Manso.

These range from basic campsites where you can bring your own tent to more elaborate luxury glamping accommodations like those offered by Río Manso Camp.

This is a beautiful but remote destination quite close to the Argentine-Chilean border, so you'll want to bring everything you need with you to avoid driving back and forth to the nearest town.

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rio Manso Expediciones (@riomansoexpediciones)

Rafting on Río Manso

Another popular activity in El Manso is river rafting on the Río Manso, whose name translates to 'Gentle River'.

But don't let the name fool you because Río Manso has class III & IV rapids.

If you're looking for something with less adrenaline, opt for the 'family float' which takes you on a leisurely float down a calmer part of the river.

River rafting in El Manso is an activity you can book with Río Manso Expediciones.

Fiesta Gaucha

Fiesta gaucha literally translates to 'gaucho party' and it's a festival that celebrates Patagonia's gaucho heritage and traditions.

These events typically draw a lot of people and it's an opportunity to watch horse races, cattle roping, bronc riding, not to mention the live music, traditional dances and asados (BBQs) that also take place.

The fiesta gaucha event is something that only happens a couple of times a year, but if you happen to be in the area at the right time, it's worth attending.

I would suggest checking out the El Manso Turismo Facebook Page for upcoming events.

Where to stay in El Manso

Accommodations in El Manso consist of campsites.

These include Camping La Pasarela del Manso, Camping Parador El Maitén, Camping La Estancia, Camping Tierraventura, Camping Río Manso, and Camping Los Aromos.

All of these campsites are right next to each other on the shores of Río Manso.

Cholila

Cholila is a small Andean town made up of four valleys and its name means 'beautiful valley' in the Mapuche language. This is a very green area surrounded by lakes and rivers, and it offers camping and cabins for those who want an off-the-beaten-path Patagonian holiday.

Top attractions in Cholila

Festival Nacional del Asado

Once a year thousands of people descend upon the small Patagonian town of Cholila to attend an event unlike any other: La Fiesta Nacional del Asado!

If there's one thing you need to understand about Argentina, it's that an asado (or barbecue) is an event that brings people together. It's not just about eating meat, but the sobremesa which is the tradition of spending time relaxing after a meal, chatting, and enjoying each other's company. This is why asados are usually a full-day event.

Now take this, add thousands of people attending the biggest party of the year with gauchos grilling thousands of kilos of meat. Plus add live music, folklore dancing, horse competitions, and you’ve got yourself quite the festival!

The National Asado Festival is a one-of-a-kind event with great energy, so if you’re planning to travel to Patagonia during the month of February, you need to check it out!

Cholila Ranch

Cholila has become synonymous with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but how did two American outlaws end up in Patagonia?

Well, after their criminal activities caught up with them in the American Wild West, they boarded a British steamer called the Herminius using fake identities and sailed to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

They eventually made their way south, passing through Trelew, and settling in Cholila. They were searching for a place in Patagonia off-the-beaten-path - a place where they could lose themselves, and they found it here.

In Cholila, they bought land, cattle, sheep and horses and lived in a four-room cabin.

Today, you can visit the Cholila Ranch and the museum which recounts the tale of the doomed outlaws.

Where to stay in Cholila

Piuke Mapu Patagonia Hostel - eco-friendly hostel with scenic views and parkland offering bunk and double rooms with shared bathroom, or a queen room with ensuite.

El Bolsón

El Bolsón is the best-known of these 7 underrated destinations in the Comarca Andina, however, it's still a well-kept secret when you compare it to the likes of Bariloche. This mountain town has the most epic mountain views and you can still experience Patagonia off-the-beaten-path via the many hiking trails, some of which lead to turquoise swimming holes.

Top attractions in El Bolsón

Sculpture Forest

The Sculpture Forest, or Bosque Tallado, is a major highlight in El Bolsón, located on Cerro Piltriquitrón.

The art project emerged after fires devastated part of the mountainside. Seizing the chance to turn tragedy into beauty, local artist Marcelo López invited fellow artists to create sculptures using burnt and fallen trees.

This inspiring initiative began in 1998 and continues to evolve, with new artists invited every few years to contribute to the ever-growing Sculpture Forest.

Local Hiking Trails

El Bolsón is a paradise for hiking enthusiasts, boasting numerous scenic trails and breathtaking landscapes to discover.

The area is famous for its lush forests, pristine rivers, and mountain panoramas, attracting nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. The trails vary in length and difficulty, offering options for all skill levels.

Among the notable trails are Cerro Amigo, Cascada Escondida, Cabeza del Indio, Cajón del Azul, and Cerro Piltriquitrón, each promising a rewarding and unforgettable hiking experience.

Feria Artesanal

El Bolson's Feria Artesanal is an outdoor hippie fair that takes place in Plaza Pagano on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays.

It's one of El Bolsón's main attractions featuring over 200 vendors selling everything from leather goods and tapestries to honey and natural cosmetics.

You can also find food trucks on site where you can enjoy some classic Argentine foods like empanadas (a meat-filled pastry) and choripán (grilled sausage on a bun).

Where to stay in El Bolsón

La Aguada – boutique accommodations with a swimming pool, gardens and epic mountain views at the foot of Cerro Piltriquitrón.

Casas Chaura – artsy two-story cabins ideal for 2-5 guests just 6 blocks from the centre of town.

Camping La Cascada – campsite on the outskirts of town right next to a waterfall and the botanic gardens, featuring a mix of hobbit houses, tiny cabins, and campsites.

The name translates to 'standing rock' and it refers to a giant monolith that rises over 210 metres from the Chubut Valley, seemingly without explanation.

It stands in a natural protected area about 130 kilometres east of Esquel and it's a bit of a natural wonder.

This was one of the many excursions we went on because even though there are plenty of things to do in Esquel, there are even more interesting and unusual attractions to visit nearby.

So, after spending a few days hiking around town, we booked a day trip to Piedra Parada. After all, it is one of the more unique places to visit in Chubut!

How to visit Piedra Parada

We decided to join an organized tour to Piedra Parada through Meraki Sur. They are a local tour operator with offices in Esquel, so we ended up booking several activities through them.

On the morning of the tour, they came to pick us up from our accommodations, we hopped in their van, and off we went!

Leaving Esquel, we drove on Ruta Nacional 259 heading southeast, then Ruta Nacional 40 heading north, before turning onto Ruta Provincial 12 heading east.

Eventually, the paved road gave way to gravel and we bounced along until we reached Gualjaina.

This small community is located 90 kilometres east of Esquel and was the last service area before reaching our destination. Here we had a quick pit stop (last bathrooms for the day!) and picked up a few snacks for the road.

It was about a 2-and-a-half-hour drive to reach Piedra Parada Nature Reserve, locally known as Área Natural Protegida Piedra Parada, and during that time, we watched the landscape change from lush forests and mountains to arid Patagonian steppe.

Touring Piedra Parada

So what is Piedra Parada?

After all, there must be some explanation for this strange rock that rises from the valley of the Chubut River.

The answer is that Piedra Parada's origins are volcanic, and once upon a time, this area would have been the caldera of an ancient mega volcano. In quite a dramatic fashion, this rock has been referred to as the bowels of that ancient volcano.

The volcano would have first erupted some 60 million years ago before the Andes were even formed, so this rock right here has witnessed a lot of history.

Once we arrived at Piedra Parada, we spent about 30 minutes touring the area with our guide.

We learned that this volcano would've had a diameter of about 25 kilometres. When the volcanic eruption occurred, the volcanic lava turned into rocks of different shades, which gave the landscape its rich, warm colours.

The free-standing rock we see today has a standing base of 100 meters and a height of 210 meters. It’s also considered a top destination for rock climbing.

If you're the kind of person who enjoys learning all sorts of interesting facts, then a guided tour of Piedra Parada is the way to go! That being said, those who were less interested in facts and more keen on taking photos also had the freedom to wander around on their own.

After a guided walk around this massive monolith, we returned to the van, which was now parked near the banks of the Chubut River underneath a tree.

Here we enjoyed a group picnic complete with empanadas, mini-pizzas, sandwiches, pigs in a blanket, and more.

The setting was beautiful and we were happy to eat and gather our energy for the next part of the tour - a hike into the Vulture's Canyon!

Hiking the Vulture's Canyon

We then drove across the Chubut River towards Cañon de la Buitrera, which literally translates to the Vulture’s Canyon.

The canyon stretches 8 kilometres with a 3-kilometre walking trail, and the walls stand around 150 meters high. We didn't hike the full length of the canyon, but rather enjoyed some of the points of interest along the way.

We got lucky spotting some of the local wildlife, namely chinchillones. These animals are also known as Southern viscacha and they look like giant chinchillas.

They live in small groups in rocky mountain areas and they have slightly long ears, slightly reminiscent of a rabbit.

Aside from that, we were super fortunate to see the condors that inhabit the high places of this canyon.

Climbing up to the caves

During our hike through the Vulture's Canyon, our guide led us up to the aleros, which are small refuges in the rock, almost like caves.

These would have been used by the pre-Tehuelches and Tehuelches who inhabited this area in a seasonal manner up to 5000 years ago.

We learned about how they would’ve stored their guanaco meat in the ground under layers of salt to help preserve it. We also learned how they would've used volcanic glass (a product of the rapidly cooling magma) to make tips for their arrows.

Plus, there were fossils and cave paintings!

There were lots of info boards inside these caves, so it's worth the hike up to read and learn more about the history of the area. The info boards are in Spanish, English and Portuguese.

Rock climbing at Piedra Parada

So, as we’ve already mentioned, Piedra Parada is a really popular rock climbing destination.

This place was really put on the tourist map back in 2012 when the Petzl brand, which is known for organizing rock climbing gatherings, chose Piedra Parada as its destination of the year.

Now, this canyon draws climbers from all over the world and we got to see them in action. Just look for the white talcum powder marks on the rocks and you'll be able to spot the climbers slowly making their way up the massive rock walls.

If you want to rock climb at Piedra Parada, I would suggest reading this guide by The Wandering Climber. It has a lot of useful information about routes, equipment needed, camping on-site and more.

You can also inquire at local travel agencies about tours specifically geared towards climbers. Plus, you can try reaching out to the local mountaineering club, Club Andino Esquel, for info on upcoming outings.

Back to Esquel

By the time we finished our hike in the Vulture's Canyon, it was merienda time, also known as afternoon tea time.

Back at the van, our driver was waiting for the group with tea, coffee and a selection of pastries, so we were very happy hikers.

We then hopped back in the van and began the drive back to Esquel.

That was our day trip to Piedra Parada! It was a lot of fun and one of the highlights of our time in Esquel.

I would say it's one of the top things to see in Patagonia if you enjoy quirky and lesser-known destinations.

If you have the time, a few other trips to consider include Los Alerces National Park, the Welsh town of Trevelin, and Butch Cassidy's ranch in Cholila.

As we've mentioned, the Province of Chubut has some real gems, so if you can, give yourself about a week to explore Esquel when planning your Northern Patagonia travels.

Lastly, for those who prefer video, here's our vlog of the experience so you know what to expect!

Puerto Madero is Buenos Aires' youngest neighbourhood and it has experienced quite the makeover! The former docklands district is now home to glass high rises, riverfront promenades, and former red brick warehouses that hold gelato shops, cafes and restaurants. It feels modern and polished, yet you still catch glimpses of its working-port past in the towering yellow cranes and the old docks lining the water.

We’ve been on a quest to experience every neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, and most recently used Puerto Madero as our base. Well, it turned out to be a wonderful surprise for our entire family!

Our days in Puerto Madero were spent spotting birds at the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve, strolling the riverside trails, playing with our daughter at the Museum of Imagination and Play, and diving right into the local Argentine food scene.

What surprised me the most about staying in Puerto Madero is how family-friendly it is. Maybe it's because we're currently travelling with our toddler, but I couldn't help but notice the leafy parks and plazas with play areas, the museums and activities geared at young children, and the number of young parents pushing their little ones around in strollers!

I think anyone can enjoy Puerto Madero (I also visited pre-baby!), but I dare say this may be the best neighbourhood to stay in if you're travelling with a young family. It offers the perfect balance of big-city energy with easy, relaxed vibes.

In this Puerto Madero neighbourhood guide, I'm going to share what there is to see and do, some easy day trips to consider, where to eat and where to stay, along with some practical advice. If you're planning a trip to Buenos Aires, read on and see if Puerto Madero is the right neighbourhood for you. 

Things to do in Puerto Madero

Let's kick things off with some of the main attractions which include everything from parks to ship museums!

Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur

The Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur, or South Coastal Ecological Reserve, is located in Puerto Madero's east end, and I can best describe it as Buenos Aires’ wild backyard! 

This eco reserve is made up of 350 hectares of wetlands, lagoons and riverfront trails right on the Río de la Plata. We spent a morning exploring the area while our baby napped in her stroller, and we were pleasantly surprised by the boardwalks, lookouts and dirt paths offering pretty spectacular views of nature and Puerto Madero's skyscrapers on the horizon.

Also, if you're a bird nerd, you'll love this place as more than 200 species of birds have been recorded! We were fortunate enough to spot several herons as well as a snake, but you can also expect lizards, otters, opossums, guinea pigs, turtles, and many more.

There are three main lagoons in the reserve: Laguna de las Gaviotas or the Seagulls Lagoon, Laguna de los Patos or the Duck Lagoon, and Laguna de los Coipos or the Otter Lagoon.

Entry to the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve is free and it is open Tuesday to Sunday (closed Mondays).

If you're visiting during the warmer months, you'll want to bring water, sun protection and maybe even insect repellent. Plan on 2–3 hours if you want to reach the river viewpoints and enjoy the feeling of being out of the city.

Puerto Madero Docks and Cranes

Puerto Madero’s waterfront promenade is all about the contrast: glassy high-rises and polished steakhouse patios on one side, old brick warehouses and bright yellow port cranes on the other. 

The docks were once a working port and the restored cranes have been left in place as industrial sculptures, a reminder of the days when they loaded grain and goods bound for Europe.

The wide pedestrian paths along the diques are perfect for an easy, stroller-friendly walk, with plenty of spots to sit, people-watch and photograph the skyline reflected in the water.

Puente de la Mujer

Puente de la Mujer translates to ""Woman's Bridge"" and it is a major landmark in Puerto Madero. The sleek white pedestrian bridge was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

If you're like me, you may be wondering why it's called the Woman's Bridge. It doesn't exactly look like a woman! Well, apparently, it's supposed to resemble a couple dancing tango! Maybe the bend of a woman's knee?

Another fun fact about Puente de la Mujer is that the central section of the bridge rotates to allow boats to pass through. We didn't get to see this, but I imagine it would be quite the event!

If you're visiting Puerto Madero, you'll likely hit up this attraction without even trying, as it naturally connects the east and west sides of the Río Darsena Sur, which is lined with restaurants, cafes and shops on both sides. 

Museo de la Imaginación y el Juego (MIJU)

Puerto Madero is a very family-friendly neighbourhood, especially if you have young children. One attraction that stood out to me is the Museo de la Imaginación y el Juego (MIJU) or the Museum of Imagination and Play.

This museum is dedicated entirely to kids aged 0–12, and it has three floors divided by age categories: 0–3, 4–7, and 8–12.

Each level has different installations for climbing, building, experimenting and play. Plus, they also have an outdoor garden with lots of fun play areas for burning off energy. 

For the indoor portion of the museum, you need to book a timed slot online in advance. The duration of this play slot is one hour. 

Only children pay admission, and while parents go in for free, there can only be one accompanying adult. This is done for crowd control and it gives kids more space to play.

To make a reservation at the Museum of Imagination and Play, visit the MIJU Instagram page, click the link in bio, select your child's age category, and choose a time slot.

Wednesdays are usually free entry for everyone with prior reservation. That being said, prices and policies can change, so it's always best to double-check the official site before you go.

We didn't book the indoor portion before arriving, and we learned that the last session of the day was completely full, so we just enjoyed the outdoor playground with our daughter. But that's a good lesson in planning in advance!

Lastly, if you're wondering about some of the Bavarian scenes on the museum's stained glass windows and along the outer walls (I know, I was!), this is because this building used to house the Munich Brewery. It's nice to see that it has retained a bit of its history. 

Buque Museo Corbeta ARA Uruguay

The ARA Uruguay is the oldest ship still afloat in the Argentine Navy and it is moored on Dique 4, where it has been transformed into a museum.

This steel-hulled corvette was built in England in 1874, and it was operational up until 1926. During that time, the ARA Uruguay served as a gunboat, a school ship, an expedition support ship, and a survey vessel, but it is perhaps best known for its Antarctic rescue.

In 1903, when the Swedish Antarctic expedition led by Otto Nordenskjöld ran into trouble, it was the ARA Uruguay that went to the rescue. Nordenskjöld's vessel, Antarctic, had become trapped in ice for a second time, suffered damage, began to take on water and sank!

Helmed by Captain Julián Irízar, the ARA Uruguay was able to rescue all of the Antarctic's crew members, and they were welcomed back in Buenos Aires as heroes with pomp and circumstance.

So that's a quick history of the Corbeta ARA Uruguay. It is now a floating museum, and you can go aboard to explore the passageways, peer into the cabins, and imagine what the long voyages of the late 19th and early 20th centuries must have been like! 

Buque Museo Fragata ARA Presidente Sarmiento

Just one dock south on Dique 3, you'll find the ARA Presidente Sarmiento. This is a three-masted training ship that launched in 1897 and was once among the most advanced vessels of its time. Today, it is the last cruising training ship from the 1890s that is still intact. 

During her service as a navy school ship, the ARA Presidente Sarmiento completed 37 voyages around the world between 1899 and 1938, representing Argentina at events like the opening of the Panama Canal, and has now retired as a museum and National Historic Monument.

Today, visitors can explore multiple decks, from officers’ quarters and cadet bunks to the engine room and galley, with exhibits explaining the ship's routes, technology and daily life on board.

What stands out the most from my visit aboard the ARA Presidente Sarmiento was seeing the taxidermied body of the crew's pet dog. His name was Lampazo, the Spanish word for the brush used to scrub the deck, and he was a Newfoundland dog. He is best remembered for leaping into a stormy sea after a sailor fell overboard, and his loyalty cemented him in history.

Madero Tango

I have written a very detailed guide to Buenos Aires' best tango shows, and if this is something you're looking to experience, you'll be pleased to hear that Puerto Madero also has tango!

Madero Tango is a restaurant and show venue set next to the water with large windows that frame the river and skyline.

It offers a few different options, including tango lessons, a multi-course dinner and show, or just the show.

Every tango show is a little bit different, and this one is more of a high-energy production that blends traditional tango with modern choreography, a live orchestra and some Broadway flair. 

If you’re staying in Puerto Madero and want something convenient and walkable after a day of sightseeing along the docks, this location is hard to beat.

Parks and Plazas

There are so many green spaces in Puerto Madero, that it would be almost impossible to name every park and plaza, so I'll just highlight a few.

Plaza Haroldo Conti has a really nice playground with lots of slides, swings, and giant trucks that the kids can climb. Plus, the entire plaza is shaded, which means you can let the little ones run around even in the middle of a summer day.

Rosedal de Puerto Madero is a rose garden and it's another spot to check out if you happen to visit when the rose bushes are in bloom.

Meanwhile, El Bosquecito, or the Little Forest, is a section with white poplars and tree-lined paths.

The nice thing is that all these parks and plazas are interconnected, so we enjoyed lots of long walks with our daughter in her stroller.

Boat Trips from Puerto Madero

Now that we've covered all the different things to do in Puerto Madero, let's talk about some day trips!

That's right, one of the nice things about staying in Puerto Madero during your visit to Buenos Aires is that you are right by the port. 

Sturla Viajes operates a super easy day trip to Tigre by boat. The journey is 1 hour and 50 minutes, and once you arrive, you can spend the day exploring the town's many museums, cruising the waterways and canals, and strolling the riverside promenade with an ice cream in hand.

And if you want to venture a bit further across the River Plate, you have the option of crossing over to neighbouring Uruguay. The Buquebus Terminal is located in Puerto Madero and offers departures to Colonia (1 hour and 15 minutes) and Montevideo (2 hours and 30 minutes).

We've visited both Colonia and Montevideo, and they are nice extentions to your Buenos Aires trip.

🛥️ Make your visit easy! This day trip to Tigre starts with a boat trip up the River Plate, includes snacks at Vivanco, and time to explore Puerto de Frutos and Paseo Victoria. 

Where to Eat in Puerto Madero

This neighbourhood guide to Puerto Madero wouldn't be complete without diving into the food scene, and yes, there's plenty of steak on offer, both in restaurants and street food!

Siga La Vaca

It wouldn't have been a proper visit to Puerto Madero without visiting at least one steakhouse! 

This time around, we ate at Siga La Vaca. This is an all you can eat barbecue restaurant, where you can walk up to the grill as many times as you like and sample various cuts of Argentine meat. 

I tried classics like the chorizo and the vacio, which is a flank steak. Meanwhile, Sam tried the matambre a la pizza, a thin cut of meat topped with your regular pizza toppings. Plus, they have a huge salad and pasta buffet where you can load up on side dishes. So lots to try!

Dessert is included as part of this all you can eat buffet. I opted for the flan con dulce de leche, while Sam went for the panqueque con dulce de leche - both classic Argentine desserts!

And I should mention, that you get one drink with your meal, but they do not skimp out. When you order wine, you get a whole bottle of wine to yourself! And my friend, who asked for soda, got a whole jug of soda for herself. Suffice it to say, you won't be going hungry or thirsty at Siga la Vaca!

Costanero Sur Food Stands

Costanera Sur is a long promenade that has parks to one side and the eco reserve to the other, so it's a nice place for a stroll, but did you know it's also a good place to eat?

That's because the Costanera Sur is lined with food stands that specialize in all things meat! You can't walk more than 25 meters without hitting the next stand.

We ate at Parrilla Angelito, but most food carts have a similar menu that features choripán (sausage on a bun), sandwich de bife (beef sandwich), pancho (hot dog on a bun), hamburgers and fries. 

This is a nice and easy option if you're looking to grab lunch on the go. 

Lucciano's

Ice cream was a daily occurrence during our stay in Puerto Madero. We visited in late spring and the days were hot and humid!

We came across Lucciano's while walking along the port and it was an instant hit! I got a scoop of coconut and another of strawberry cream. I love creamy, fruity flavours, so it was just what I needed.

The interior has a very Italian vibe, and it was just nice to cool down in an air-conditioned space. 

Where to Stay in Puerto Madero

Puerto Madero is one of the more upscale neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and it comes with a price tag. If you're looking for 5-star accommodations, you're in the right place. 

Hotel Faena - This hotel is set in an industrial red brick building, and it is known for its opulent decor with pops of red! It has a spa centre with a pool and hammam, a restaurant with an Italian-Sardinian menu, and it also hosts a cabaret-style tango show.

Hotel Madero - This property is a member of WorldHotels Elite and all of its rooms have private balconies. The hotel houses the Rëd Resto & Lounge with its own wine cellar, and the White Bar which offers customized cocktails.

Alvear Icon Hotel - Located in a 32-floor tower, the Alvear Icon Hotel offers both city and river views. It has an indoor heated pool with a retractable roof, plus multiple restaurants and bars.

Aside from hotels, you can also find a lot of short-term apartment rentals. Because we were travelling with our toddler, I was quite conscious of what I did not want: no balconies, no stairs and no dangerous furniture. 

I lucked out with an AirBnB that had a kids' room with a fun safari mural, an outdoor terrace with a trampoline, and a playpen. I did pay double what I normally would elsewhere in Buenos Aires, but we wanted to experience staying in Puerto Madero, and our daughter really loved the space.

More Buenos Aires Neighbourhoods to Consider

Now that you’ve read this Puerto Madero neighbourhood guide, you can decide if it’s the right base for your trip. If you’re after a slightly different vibe, here are a few other Buenos Aires neighbourhoods to consider:

Palermo – Trendy, sprawling and leafy, Palermo is the city’s creative hub with hip cafés, independent boutiques, buzzing nightlife and huge parks. Best for foodies, digital nomads and travellers who love a vibrant, youthful atmosphere and don’t mind being a short taxi ride from the historic centre.

San Telmo – Buenos Aires’ oldest barrio is all cobblestone streets, antique markets and tango-in-the-plaza energy. Great for history buffs, art lovers and anyone who enjoys bohemian, slightly crumbling charm. Just know that some streets can be noisy late into the night thanks to bars and live music.

Recoleta – Recoleta is elegant and residential, known for its Parisian-style architecture, famous cemetery and leafy plazas. Ideal if you like a classic, refined feel with lots of cafés, museums and easy access to other central neighbourhoods.

Retiro – A mix of grand avenues, leafy squares and major transport links, Retiro gives you quick access to buses, trains and many of the city’s main sights. Good for travellers who want a central, well-connected base with a touch of old-world grandeur.

Monserrat / Microcentro – This is the political and historic heart of Buenos Aires, home to Plaza de Mayo, Casa Rosada, Barolo Palace and many landmark buildings. Perfect if you want to be in the middle of the action during the day. Some blocks feel a bit more hectic and gritty, and it quiets down a lot at night.

La Boca – Colourful, raw and full of character, La Boca is where you’ll find Caminito, street tango and intense fútbol culture. I’d treat it as a daytime sightseeing neighbourhood rather than a place to stay overnight, and stick to the main tourist area.

Chacarita – A rising star with a local, lived-in feel, known for its massive cemetery, craft breweries and creative scene. Great for travellers who enjoy off-the-beaten-path neighbourhoods, café-hopping and a more residential vibe.

Villa Crespo – Palermo’s quieter neighbour with lower-key charm, emerging restaurants and indie shops. Ideal if you like staying somewhere that feels local and authentic, while still being close enough to Palermo’s parks and nightlife when you want it.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,d8edd66c04e0aa262b6f84a464ae7f5eac030449

Located in the Province of Chubut, just 13 kilometres from the oil capital of Comodoro Rivadavia, Rada Tilly makes for a really nice day trip offering wide beaches, impressive cliffs, gourmet dining, and the chance to see sea lions!

If you're planning to travel coastal Patagonia and you're going to be in the vicinity of Comodoro Rivadavia, then you won't want to miss out on a visit to neighbouring Rada Tilly.

Here are some ideas on how to spend your day there.

How to get to Rada Tilly

By bus

You can catch the bus to Rada Tilly from the Comodoro Rivadavia Bus Terminal. Bus #10 is operated by Expreso Rada Tilly and runs daily every 25-30 minutes.

You have to get a reloadable card to travel on this bus, but you can do so right at the ticketing counter. Just ask them to load two trips (there and back) and you're all set for your day trip to Rada Tilly.

The bus journey takes about 30 minutes depending on how many stops the bus driver makes along the way, and it costs under $1 USD to get there.

You can view the bus schedule here.

By car

If you are renting a car during your stay, you can drive from Comodoro Rivadavia to Rada Tilly in just under 20 minutes.

It's a 13-kilometre drive along Ruta Nacional 3 and you'll see the turn-off for Villa Rada Tilly on the left-hand side.

Things to do in Rada Tilly

What can you do in Rada Tilly on a day trip? Turns out, quite a bit! Here's a taste of what you can get up to in this seaside town on a short visit.

Enjoy the southernmost beach resort

As we mentioned earlier, Rada Tilly is considered the southernmost seaside resort in South America.

The warmest the water ever gets is about 17°C or 62°F, so it’s really not that warm, but it only gets chillier from here on south!

We visited quite early in the summer, so while we noticed a few brave kids running into the water, most people were just sunbathing.

If you do visit, pack your swimsuit, but maybe also a windbreaker - you never know which one you might need!

The best part about the beach in Rada Tilly is that it is incredibly wide during low tide. You can walk really far out seeing all the shells that are left exposed on the seabed, plus you have these imposing cliffs on the south end which add a bit of drama.

This seaside town is another reason you'll want to visit Chubut!

Watch the wind buggies race

Rada Tilly Beach is a popular destination for all sorts of wind sports like windsurfing and kitesurfing, but did you know there's also land sailing?

That's right, this is a sport where three-wheeled carts with a sail attached to them move using the force of the wind.

The vehicles are known as wind carts or wind buggies, and there's even a land sailing school on the beach's north end called Asociación Patagónica de Carrovelismo.

You can catch them practising on this very beach, and they also hold annual competitions, so if you time your visit right you can watch the wind buggies race in the championship!

Check out the beachfront homes

One of the things we found most interesting about Rada Tilly were the beach homes built in all sorts of different styles!

One thing to note about Rada Tilly is that it's considered a weekend getaway and summer playground for a lot of people who work in Comodoro's Rivadavia oil industry, so that means big money.

You'll notice a mix of elegant houses and even grand mansions as you enjoy a stroll along the Costanera which runs parallel to Avenida Armada Argentina.

There was one house in particular that caught our attention and looked like it had been inspired by Santorini with a splash of neighbouring Turkey. It was painted white with blue domes, but it also had architectural elements that resembled a minaret.

Not at all what we expected to find in this part of the world!

Lunch at #in Restaurant

We only had one day in Rada Tilly so we wanted to enjoy a nice seaside meal, and I really think we chose right with #in Restaurant.

This is a restaurant by day that turns into more of a beach lounge and sushi bar by night.

They had a really nice menu featuring a mix of Patagonian dishes.

While we waited for our mains, we were served two loaves of bread fresh out of the oven with a garlicky spread.

I ordered the seafood risotto with shrimp, squid, mussels and scallops. It was creamy, butter and cheesy - you could see the strings of cheese with every bite! The perfect dish to enjoy by the seaside.

Meanwhile, Sam ordered the lamb with caramelized onions and a side of risotto alla Milanese (the secret ingredient here is saffron). This was probably the best dish on the menu and Sam proceeded to declare it the best lamb he's had in his life.

To accompany the meal, we got a bottle of Patagonian wine called La Poderosa by Bodega Fin del Mundo.

And after such a fabulous meal, we couldn't resist dessert and got the dulce de leche volcano. This is a warm brownie with a warm, gooey caramel in the middle that spills out when you cut into the dessert. It had a light dusting of powdered sugar and it was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I can't say enough good things about this meal. It really was wonderful!

See the sea lions at Punta Marqués

Punta Marqués is a popular spot to go see sea lions. Most people visit on a day trip from Comodoro Rivadavia, but it's even closer to Rada Tilly!

If you're up for a workout, you can hike up from the beach - it's a 6-kilometre walk from the south end. You just need to get on the road Al Mirador, which means 'to the lookout'. It's a dirt road and there are trails that break away as shortcuts.

If you decide to walk, make sure you have plenty of water, sunscreen and a sunhat as there is no shade and the climate here is quite dry and arid.

However, if you can, I would suggest paying for a taxi to take you up to the viewpoint. You can get them to wait for you and then drive back.

And if you really feel like you need more time, you can always walk back (it's easier on the way down).

Visit the Rada Tilly Regional Museum

If you're up for a museum visit, the Rada Tilly Regional Museum is a cute little spot to check out.

This museum focuses on showcasing the native flora and fauna of the Patagonian steppe; you can see sea lions, Magellanic penguins, rheas, albatross and other wildlife.

They also have displays with fossils from different geological eras as well as the various ethnohistorical groups that inhabited this area.

Admission to the museum was the equivalent of $0.50 USD and it can be done as a self-guided visit.

And that's a taste of what you can get up to in Rada Tilly! It's a great day trip from Comodoro Rivadavia, but if you have the time to linger for a few days, you'll be able to soak the beach vibes even more.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,e09fae7dc7b6f76eeab2d0c5cb09c27e0a275f96
8d12e191d1a9cb40b438be4b08452b0cdb5fd9ba,che_argentina_travel,en,Recoleta Cemetery: Exploring Buenos Aires’ Most Famous Burial Ground,"Recoleta Cemetery is ranked among the most beautiful cemeteries in the world, and visiting is one of those quintessential Buenos Aires experiences! 

Known locally as Cementerio de la Recoleta, this historic necropolis is far more than a burial ground; it’s a labyrinth of marble mausoleums, a who’s who of Argentine history, and an open-air museum that tells the story of a nation through architecture and memory.

For first-time visitors, Recoleta Cemetery can feel a little overwhelming at first. There are thousands of tombs, winding cobblestone paths, and layers upon layers of history. 

This guide is here to help you make the most of your visit, whether you’ve come for Evita’s famous tomb, to admire the Belle Époque architecture, or simply to soak up the atmosphere of this hauntingly beautiful place.

A Brief History of Recoleta Cemetery

Recoleta Cemetery was founded in 1822, making it the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires. 

It occupies land that originally belonged to the adjoining Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pilar, and the surrounding neighbourhood eventually adopted the name Recoleta from the Recollect monks who once lived here.

In its early years, the cemetery was fairly modest, but during Argentina’s Golden Age (late 19th–early 20th century), Buenos Aires’ wealthy elite began transforming it into something extraordinary. 

Inspired by European cemeteries like Père Lachaise in Paris, families competed to build the most elaborate mausoleums, hiring top architects, importing marble from Italy, and commissioning sculptures from Europe’s best ateliers.

By the turn of the century, Recoleta Cemetery had become a symbol of status and legacy. Presidents, generals, poets, aristocrats, and cultural icons were laid to rest here, their tombs often as grand as palaces. 

In 1946, the cemetery was declared a National Historic Monument, cementing its role as both a sacred site and a cultural landmark.

Visitor Essentials

Before you start wandering the cemetery’s atmospheric alleys, here are a few practical details to help you plan your visit:

CategoryDetails📍 LocationJunín 1760, Recoleta, Buenos Aires🕒 Opening HoursDaily 7 a.m.–6 p.m. (check locally)💰 Entry FeeFree for Argentines; small fee for foreigners (subject to change)⏱ Suggested Visit Time1–2 hours🗺 ToursFree group tours or private guides available in English and Spanish (check schedule)🦽 AccessibilityMostly flat but cobblestoned paths, so wear comfy shoes

TIP: Early mornings and late afternoons are the best times to visit Recoleta Cemetery. You'll find fewer tour groups, softer light, and a more peaceful atmosphere.

Layout & Atmosphere

Recoleta Cemetery covers around 5.5 hectares, with paths laid out in a grid system reminiscent of a small city. In fact, locals sometimes refer to it as a “city of the dead.” 

The narrow cobblestone alleys are lined with more than 6,400 mausoleums, statues and chapels, some simple and others jaw-droppingly ornate. I was surprised to even see some coffins exposed to the elements; you get a sense of the passing of time here.

Architecturally, it’s a feast for the eyes. You’ll spot Neo-Gothic, Art Deco, Baroque, and Art Nouveau designs all within a few steps. Many of these tombs were designed by Argentina’s most celebrated architects and sculptors, and some were even imported directly from Europe.

One of my favourite things about visiting is the cats lounging on marble steps, though if you're visiting now, you're less likely to spot them! As it turns out, Recoleta's strays have been getting adopted and this combined with a spay and neuter campaign has proven rather effective. 

Notable Tombs & Points of Interest

While you could easily spend hours wandering aimlessly (and I recommend leaving a little time for that), there are a few key tombs and stories you shouldn’t miss:

Eva Perón (Evita)

The most visited tomb in the cemetery belongs to Eva Perón, Argentina’s beloved and controversial First Lady. Her remains rest in the Duarte family mausoleum, a surprisingly modest black marble tomb tucked along a narrow alley. There’s almost always a small crowd gathered, leaving flowers or snapping photos.

Rufina Cambaceres

Perhaps the most haunting story is that of Rufina Cambaceres, a young socialite who was allegedly buried alive after falling into a cataleptic coma in 1902. Her Art Nouveau tomb shows her elegantly opening a door, as if emerging back into life.

Admiral Guillermo Brown

Admiral Guillermo Brown was an Irish-born sailor who became the father of the Argentine Navy. His mausoleum stands out with its naval motifs and historic significance.

María Remedios de Escalada

María de los Remedios de Escalada y La Quintana was the wife of General José de San Martín, the liberator of Argentina, Chile and Peru. She was only 25 years old when she died. Her tomb is a simple and austere white marble with an inscription that reads, ""Here lies Remedios de Escalada, wife and friend of Gen. S. Martín.""

Luis Ángel Firpo

Known as “The Wild Bull of the Pampas,” Firpo was a famous boxer whose bronze statue depicts him mid-punch.

Dorrego Ortiz Basualdo Family Mausoleum

This grand structure showcases French-inspired architecture at its most opulent. It is one of many tombs that feels more like a mini palace than a resting place.

David Alleno

Perhaps the most curious figure is David Alleno, the cemetery’s caretaker who spent his life saving money to build his own tomb, which features a life-size statue of himself holding keys. Legend has it he took his life right after it was completed so he could “move in” early.

TIP: Pick up a paper map at the entrance to help you find the key sites. The tombs aren’t always well signposted, and some of the most fascinating stories are down the quietest lanes.

Tips for First-Time Visitors

Wear comfy shoes because those cobblestones can be tricky after an hour of wandering.

Bring water and sunscreen if visiting during the warmer months because there’s little shade.

Photography is allowed and encouraged, but be respectful. Early morning and late afternoon are best for soft, golden light.

Be mindful that this is still an active cemetery, so you may see families visiting loved ones.

Take your time. Even if you’re not usually a “cemetery person,” the architecture and stories are genuinely captivating.

Recoleta Cemetery FAQs 

How much time do I need at Recoleta Cemetery? Plan for 60–90 minutes. If you’re a photography or architecture fan, budget up to 2 hours to wander beyond the main lanes. What are the opening hours? Generally 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily. Hours can change on holidays, so glance at the sign at the entrance or the city tourism site before you go. Is there an entrance fee? It’s free for Argentine residents; foreign visitors may pay a small fee. This policy has changed over time, so bring a payment card or small cash just in case.

History lovers will enjoy a guided tour (city-run or private) to unlock the best stories in less time. What are the can’t-miss tombs?

Final Thoughts

Even if cemeteries aren’t usually on your travel list, Recoleta Cemetery is different. It’s part history book, part sculpture gallery, part architectural showcase, and it captures something essential about Buenos Aires’ past and identity.

Things to Do in Recoleta

Recoleta Cemetery

A cemetery may seem like a bit of a morbid attraction, but Recoleta Cemetery is one of Buenos Aires’ most iconic landmarks!

Established in 1822 on the grounds of a former convent, this became the city’s first public cemetery and soon evolved into the final resting place of Argentina’s elite. It is home to many notable figures, including several presidents, military leaders, Nobel Prize winners, athletes, and members of the city’s most powerful families. 

Recoleta Cemetery feels like a mini city, complete with cobblestone paths and a maze of more than 6,400 mausoleums and tombs, many designed by leading architects and sculptors of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Most visitors make a beeline for the black marble tomb of Eva Perón, better known as Evita.

I have visited Recoleta Cemetery many times over the years, and one of the big draws was the stray cats who lived there! Well, today, you'll be hard-pressed to find these felines, but that's because they have been adopted, and those who remain have been spayed and neutered. So while I miss spotting the cats napping in the mausoleums, it's actually good news.

Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pilar

Standing beside Recoleta Cemetery, you'll find the Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pilar, one of Buenos Aires’ oldest churches.

Completed in 1732, it was originally part of a Franciscan monastery and is a rare surviving example of colonial baroque architecture in the city. Its white façade and understated interior contrast with the grandeur of the surrounding Belle Époque buildings.

Inside, the basilica you'll find altarpieces, religious paintings, and ornate silverwork, offering a glimpse into the city’s early colonial history and devotion. 

Centro Cultural Recoleta

Housed in a former 18th-century convent, the Centro Cultural Recoleta is one of Buenos Aires’ most vibrant creative hubs, blending historic architecture with contemporary culture.

Located right next to Recoleta Cemetery, this space features a constantly changing lineup of exhibitions, performances and workshops that showcase cutting-edge Argentine and international art.

The building itself retains beautiful colonial elements, including courtyards and cloisters, which now serve as lively gathering spaces. 

Fun fact about this building: it is a canvas in and of itself, and it is constantly getting repainted! Over the years, I've seen it range from a traditional terracotta colour to one covered in bold shapes and patterns.

Feria de Recoleta

The Feria de Recoleta, or Recoleta Market, is a lively weekend artisan fair that takes place in Plaza Francia, right beside Recoleta Cemetery and the Centro Cultural Recoleta.

The fair is held every Saturday, Sunday, and public holiday, transforming the park into a bustling open-air market filled with hundreds of stalls run by local artisans.

Here you’ll find a wide range of artisanal goods that make great souvenirs, including leather accessories, silver jewelry, mate gourds, ceramics, textiles, original artwork, and quirky souvenirs that make for meaningful keepsakes. 

Walk the Plazas

Recoleta is a neighbourhood of parks and plazas, and the best part is that many of them are interconnected. So if you're somebody who enjoys a morning jog or stroll, you'll have plenty of paths to choose from.

Some of my favourites are Parque Vicente Lopez y Planes with its huge gomero tree. I always enjoy seeing the dog walkers here who bring the dogs to play. 

Meanwhile, Plaza San Martín de Tours has a nice hill, and it's a beautiful spot to lounge and admire the surrounding architecture. 

Floralis Generica

Floralis Genérica is one of Buenos Aires’ most striking modern landmarks! Located in Plaza de las Naciones Unidas, it is a massive steel and aluminum flower sculpture that opens and closes.

Designed by Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano and inaugurated in 2002, the 20-meter-tall flower was originally engineered to open at dawn and close at night. This daily movement made it a living, breathing artwork that mirrored the rhythms of the city.

Unfortunately, the sculpture has been affected by extreme weather over the years. First, a powerful storm in 2010 damaged the mechanism that controlled the petals, leaving the flower permanently open for several years until 2015.

Then, strong winds hit the sculpture again in 2023, and two of the petals bent and fell during the storm. So, it's not quite what it used to be, but it's still an important attraction in Recoleta.

Arandu Talabarteria

Arandú Talabartería is a beautiful store that specializes in traditional Argentine products that represent the countryside. They have a handful of stores across the city, including one in the neighbourhood of Recoleta. 

Here you can find leather goods, riding boots, silver jewellery, polo shirts, gaucho clothing, and so much more. 

The space has been carefully curated, and it almost feels like a museum, so it's worth a peek if you're in the area. 

Patio Bullrich

Once an upscale auction house for thoroughbred cattle, Patio Bullrich is now one of Buenos Aires’ most elegant shopping centers.

Located at the edge of Recoleta, this beautifully restored 19th-century building features ornate ironwork, marble details, and a soaring glass roof, giving the mall a touch of European flair.

Inside, you’ll find a curated selection of high-end boutiques, including both international designer labels and prestigious Argentine brands.

While it’s not the largest mall in the city, it is a pleasant place to browse, enjoy a coffee, or escape a rainy afternoon in Buenos Aires.

It’s especially popular with visitors looking for leather goods, fashion, and luxury accessories.

El Ateneo Grand Splendid

Housed in a former grand theatre, El Ateneo Grand Splendid is one of the most breathtaking bookstores in the world and an absolute must-visit in Recoleta.

Built in 1919 as the Teatro Grand Splendid, the building originally hosted tango performances, live shows, and even early radio broadcasts before being transformed into a bookstore in 2000.

Today, its ornate frescoed ceiling, gilded balconies, and red stage curtains create a dramatic backdrop for rows of bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.

Visitors can browse literature in Spanish and other languages, flip through art books under the theatre’s domed ceiling, or relax with a coffee at the café set on the former stage.

Whether you’re a book lover or simply appreciate stunning architecture, El Ateneo Grand Splendid deserves a spot on your Buenos Aires itinerary!

Facultad de Derecho

The Facultad de Derecho, or the Law Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires, is one of the neighbourhood’s most imposing buildings. 

Located along Avenida Figueroa Alcorta at the edge of Recoleta, this Neo-Classical building was inaugurated in 1949. It is instantly recognizable by its façade featuring a row of massive stone columns that give it the appearance of a Greco-Roman temple.

This striking structure houses one of Argentina’s most prestigious law schools and remains an active university building, bustling with students during the academic year. 

Visitors can admire the architecture from the outside and stroll up its wide steps for a panoramic view of the surrounding area.

With the Floralis Genérica just across the street, it’s a natural stop on any Recoleta walking route.

TIP: The Law Faculty is a great spot to see the jacarandas in bloom if you're visiting Buenos Aires in the springtime!

Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes

The Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (MNBA) is Argentina’s premier fine arts museum and one of the cultural crown jewels of Buenos Aires.

Located in Recoleta, just steps from Plaza Francia, the museum occupies a former water pumping station that was converted into an exhibition space in 1933.

Its collection spans European masters, Argentine artists, and Latin American modernists. You can admire works by Goya, Rembrandt, Monet, Rodin, and Degas, alongside an extensive collection of Argentine paintings and sculptures that trace the country’s artistic evolution from the 19th century to today.

The museum’s permanent collection is free to visit, making it an accessible cultural experience for travellers, while rotating temporary exhibitions bring fresh perspectives to the space.

Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno

The Biblioteca Nacional Mariano Moreno is Argentina’s national library and a fascinating architectural landmark in Recoleta.

Completed in 1992, it’s a striking example of Brutalist architecture, with a massive concrete structure perched on stilts above open terraces and gardens. It's a very bold contrast to the surrounding Belle Époque buildings you see in Recoleta!

Named after Mariano Moreno, a key figure in Argentina’s independence movement, the library holds millions of books, manuscripts, maps, and historical documents, making it one of the most important literary institutions in Latin America. 

While it primarily serves as a research library, visitors are welcome to explore the public areas, including the lobby, reading rooms, and occasional temporary exhibitions. 

The building’s panoramic terrace also offers excellent views of the city and Río de la Plata, and architecture enthusiasts will especially enjoy its distinctive design.

This isn't your typical Recoleta tourist attraction, but it’s a worthwhile stop if you want to discover some of Buenos Aires' lesser-known sights.

Palais de Glace

Palais de Glace, also known as Palacio Nacional de las Artes, is another Belle Époque landmark in Recoleta. 

It was originally conceived as an elegant ice-skating rink and social club in the early 20th century. It then transformed into a dance hall where tango orchestras performed, before being repurposed into an art gallery.

The circular central hall, topped by a domed roof and skylight, now hosts rotating exhibitions.

Mansions and Embassies

One of the best ways to appreciate Recoleta’s timeless elegance is by setting out on a self-guided walking tour through its tree-lined streets and grand avenues. 

Start along Avenida Alvear, often compared to Paris’s Avenue Foch, where a series of Belle Époque mansions built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showcase the wealth and ambition of Argentina’s Golden Age. 

Many of these opulent residences were designed by French architects and feature wrought-iron balconies, ornate cornices, mansard roofs, and intricate stonework that echo the styles of Paris. 

Today, several of these historic buildings house embassies, cultural institutes, and luxury hotels (more on that later!). 

Where to Eat in Recoleta

La Biela

My go-to cafe whenever I'm in the Recoleta neighbourhood is La Biela. This is one of Recoleta’s most famous cafés and a designated bar notable. 

It is conveniently located on Avenida Quintana right across from the Basílica del Pilar and Recoleta Cemetery. 

Its history dates back to the mid-19th century, when it began as a simple sidewalk bar before evolving into a meeting spot for pilots and later car enthusiasts.

Over the years, La Biela became a favourite haunt of intellectuals, writers, and artists, including Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, whose table remains permanently set in their honour.

Inside, La Biela exudes old-world charm with wood panelling, vintage racing memorabilia, and black-and-white photographs, while its shaded terrace beneath a century-old rubber tree is perfect for people-watching. 

I like to stop in for merienda or tea time. If you order the Recoleta, you'll get tea with pastries and a toasted ham and cheese sandwich, which is pretty classic.

La Rambla

Café La Rambla is a beautiful corner café that has retained its authentic porteño charm since opening in 1938. 

Small, unpretentious, and full of character, it’s one of those cafés where time seems to slow down. It's a place favoured by locals for their daily coffee, medialunas, and quiet conversations. 

I first came across La Rambla on a rainy morning, looking for breakfast. The cafe won me over with its desayuno clásico featuring coffee with milk, two medialunas and a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.

El Sanjuanino

El Sanjuanino is known to serve some of the best empanadas in Buenos Aires! 

The empanadas sanjuaninas (from the province of San Juan) are their specialty. These empanadas are known for being juicy and flavorful. I would suggest trying the fritas (fried), which are infinitely superior to the horneadas (baked). 

Aside from empanadas, El Sanjuanino’s menu also features regional dishes from northern Argentina, which include staples like locro, humitas, and tamales.

Now, let me warn you, El Sanjuanino is a local institution in Recoleta. Every time I walk past it, every table is completely packed! I would suggest arriving just before they open, so you can snag a spot.

L'Orangerie at Alvear Palace Hotel

If like me, your budget doesn't stretch far enough to spend the night at Alvear Palace Hotel, another way to see the property is by having afternoon tea!

Tea is served in the winter garden, and it's an elegant affair with a spread that includes warm scones with marmalades, a tiered selection of finger sandwiches and pastries. 

They offer a wide selection of teas, among them the hotel’s signature Alvear Blend, a black tea infused with almonds, citrus, and rose petals! It's as exquisite as it sounds. 

I took my parents for afternoon tea here during one of their visits, and it was one of the highlights of our adventures across the neighbourhood of Recoleta.

Rapa Nui

Rapa Nui is an ice cream chain with branches all over Buenos Aires, however, the one in Recoleta is the one that I frequent the most. This location is set in a Belle Epoque building with high ceilings, lots of natural light and a small inner terrace.

If you have a sweet tooth, you'll love Rapa Nui because you can enjoy a mix of artisanal chocolates, helados (ice cream), and confections.

My husband loves anything with dulce de leche, whereas I tend to go for the fruit and cream combinations with forest berries. 

Buenos Aires has a serious ice cream culture, so I would highly recommend making time to visit an heladería or two!

Aramburú

If fine dining is more your scene, you'll want to visit Aramburu. This restaurant is helmed by chef Gonzalo Aramburu, and it is one of Recoleta’s most celebrated fine-dining establishments.

This is not an experience that can be booked by walking in off the street; reservations need to be made in advance.

What sets Aramburu apart is its 18-course meal featuring a seasonally evolving tasting menu that emphasizes local ingredients and playful textures. You can choose to add on a wine-pairing option to enhance the experience.

Aramburu was the first restaurant in Argentina to earn two Michelin stars, and it is also a Relais & Châteaux property. It's one of the best restaurants in Recoleta if you're looking for something sophisticated, intimate and refined.

Recoleta Neighbourhood Map

More Buenos Aires Neighbourhoods

Now that you've read this Recoleta neighbourhood guide, you can decide if it's the right place for you. If you're looking for a slightly different vibe, here are a few other Buenos Aires neighbourhoods to consider:

Palermo – Trendy, sprawling, and green, Palermo is the city’s creative heart with hip cafés, boutiques, nightlife, and parks. Best for foodies, digital nomads, and travellers who love a vibrant, youthful vibe.

San Telmo – Buenos Aires’ oldest neighbourhood is filled with cobblestone streets, antique shops, and tango culture. Perfect for history buffs, art lovers, and those who enjoy a bohemian, romantic atmosphere. I find some areas can be a bit loud at night since there's quite a bit of nightlife.

Puerto Madero – Sleek, modern, and waterfront, this area blends luxury living with scenic boardwalks and upscale dining. Ideal for travellers who love contemporary architecture, comfort, and leisurely strolls by the docks.

Retiro – A blend of elegance and transit hub energy, Retiro features grand architecture, leafy plazas, and proximity to major attractions. Great for those who want central access with a dash of old-world charm.

Monserrat / Microcentro – This neighbourhood is the political and historic core of Buenos Aires, packed with landmarks like Plaza de Mayo and Casa Rosada. Perfect for visitors who want to be in the middle of the action, especially during the day. Some parts are a bit more gritty than others. 

La Boca – Colourful, gritty, and full of character, La Boca is home to Caminito street, fútbol culture, tango and working-class history. This neighbourhood is better suited for daytime exploring, and I personally would not stay overnight here.

Chacarita – A rising star with a laid-back, local feel, known for its large cemetery, craft breweries, and creative scene. Great for travellers seeking a more authentic, untouristy slice of city life.

Villa Crespo – Palermo’s quieter, cooler neighbour, blending old-school charm with emerging restaurants and indie shops. Ideal for those who like staying local and discovering hidden gems off the main tourist trail.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,8f5097ce86601581700c5251ae8c5ec9d6a826be

This is a 107-kilometre drive that stretches between the towns of San Martín de los Andes and Villa La Angostura in the Province of Neuquén. The route goes through two national parks, Lanín National Park and Nahuel Huapi National Park, and it offers spectacular views at every turn.

The Route of the Seven Lakes runs along a scenic stretch of National Route 40, which is the highway that crosses the full length of Argentina from north to south.

Along the drive, travellers are treated to majestic views of snow-capped mountains, crystalline lakes that range from emerald to cobalt blue, and lush greenery.

The best part is that the Route of the Seven Lakes can be driven in one day, and it can be done independently or as part of a guided tour. It's one of the most beautiful places in Patagonia and is well worth experiencing.

In this blog post, we’ll tell you all about this iconic Argentine road trip!

This Seven Lakes day trip departs from Bariloche and includes stops in Villa La Angostura, the seven lakes and numerous lookout points, plus free time to explore the town of San Martin de Los Andes. 

Route of the Seven Lakes FAQs

What lakes are included in the Route of the 7 Lakes? The lakes that make up the Route of the Seven Lakes are Lake Machónico, Lake Escondido, Lake Correntoso, Lake Espejo, Lake Lácar, Lake Falkner, and Lake Villarino. Other lakes accessible through secondary paths include Lake Meliquina, Lake Hermoso, Lake Traful and Lake Espejo Chico. What other attractions can you visit along the Route of the Seven Lakes? Aside from the lakes, you can also visit Cascada Vuliñanco, a waterfall; Arroyo Partido, a stream; and Valle del Arroyo Pil Pil, a valley. How long does it take to drive the Route of the Seven Lakes? If you were to drive the Seven Lakes Route without making any stops along the way, it would take just under 2 hours to complete the 107-kilometre route. However, since this is a scenic drive, it really depends on how long you take at each place, but it can be done in one full day. What towns do you visit along the Route of the Seven Lakes? The Route of the Seven Lakes is flanked by two towns that mark the start and end of the drive: San Martín de los Andes to the north and Villa La Angostura to the south. You'll first want to get to Bariloche (you can do so via airplane, bus or train) since this is the gateway to Patagonia's Lake District. 

Driving the Route of the Seven Lakes

We chose to experience Patagonia’s Road of the Seven Lakes as part of a guided full-day tour.

We started the day in the town of San Martín de Los Andes, which is the northern tip of this route. Of course, you can also drive the route in the opposite direction.

Tours depart from Bariloche, San Martín de los Andes and Villa La Angostura. If you're spending a few days in Bariloche, this is a popular day trip you can book.

Almost all tour operators in these towns offer the Seven Lakes tour, so you can book once you arrive in town, or do so online ahead of time.

Lago Machónico

The first lake you hit when leaving the town of San Martín de los Andes is Lago Machónico. This lake is of glacial origin, and it offers beautiful views of mountain peaks covered in snow.

Because of its position, which shelters it from strong winds, this lake offers a calm setting for kayaking.

As for the lake’s name, in the Mapuche language, machónico means ‘water with pancora’. Pancora are freshwater crabs commonly found in the area that can be seen digging themselves into the pebbles in the lake.

Cascada Vuliñanco

One of the nice surprises of this guided tour was that we didn’t just visit the seven lakes, but we also made stops at other attractions and scenic lookouts along the way.

One such place was the viewpoint towards Cascada Vuliñanco. The name of this waterfall means ‘hill of the hawk’ in the Mapuche language.

The waterfall is over 20 metres in height and it splits into two veils.

Lago Falkner

The next stop along the Seven Lakes Road was Lago Falkner.

Lake Falkner is named after Thomas Falkner, a Jesuit missionary, scientist and explorer who spent almost 40 years conducting studies across Patagonia and is also credited with recording the first fossil in present-day Argentina.

This is another very serene lake with a nice beach, so it’s a nice spot for picnics and a refreshing swim.

For travellers doing this as a self-guided trip, there's the option of hiking the Cerro Falkner trail, which is 8.4 km out and back.

There’s also a camping area at this lake, for those wanting to linger and enjoy the landscapes.

Lago Villarino

Next, we reached Lago Villarino, another pristine lake at the foothills of the Andes Mountains.

This region is home to the huemul, a native Patagonian deer that lives in the highest parts of the mountains.

The lake bears the name of Basilio Villarino, a Spanish Royal Navy captain and explorer who travelled around the southern tip of South America and performed a detailed reconnaissance of Patagonia.

You can also find a campsite at this lake.

Lago Escondido

Lago Escondido means ‘hidden lake’, and it is the smallest of the seven lakes along this famous route.

This lake is surrounded by trees, especially coihué, and the reflection of the surrounding foliage causes the lake to have an emerald colour.

The forest around this lake is also home to the pudu, the smallest deer in the world which only stands between 32 to 44 centimetres tall!

The pudu is a very solitary animal whose behaviour is still largely unknown due to its secretive nature.

Lago Correntoso

The next place we visited along the Route of the Seven Lakes was Lago Correntoso.

This lake is fed by Lago Espejo via a river, which translates to ‘lake with a current’, however, the lake waters are quite calm.

Lago Correntoso is the biggest of the seven lakes, and it’s also the lake with the warmest waters, for those looking for a summer swim. Though keep in mind this is Patagonia and not the Caribbean!

During our excursion, we stopped at Hosteria 7 Lagos, which sits on the shores of Lago Correntoso. There’s a guesthouse and camping site here, and we got to explore the farm and meet all sorts of animals like ducks, geese, cats and dogs.

We also had the opportunity to get some coffee and tortas fritas, a savoury donut made with lard.

Lago Espejo

Next on our road trip of the Seven Lakes was Lago Espejo, meaning ‘mirror lake’.

This lake gets its name from its mirror-like waters, which are super calm and reflect the surrounding mountains and forest in the water.

The lake is fed by numerous streams bringing snow and ice melt from the surrounding mountains. It also features volcanic sand beaches, so it draws day visitors, especially during the summer months.

Lago Nahuel Huapi

The final lake we visited along the Route of the Seven Lakes was Lago Nahuel Huapi.

The lake’s name derives from the Mapuche language - ‘nahuel’ means puma and ‘huapí’ means island, so it is the ‘island of the puma’.

The lake is located within Nahuel Huapi National Park, which is the oldest national park in Argentina having been established in 1934.

For those lingering in the area beyond this road trip of the Seven Lakes, there’s a popular day trip to Isla Victoria where you can cruise the waters of Lake Nahuel Huapi and really soak in the scenery.

Villa La Angostura

The town of Villa La Angostura marks the end of the Route of the Seven Lakes if you’re travelling from north to south.

During this guided tour we had some time to explore a few highlights around town and the surrounding area.

First, we stopped in Puerto Manzano, which is a resort area just 7 kilometres south of Villa La Angostura.

Here you’ll find lots of hotels, cottages and holiday rentals, and since this is a port, you can also expect lakeside beaches and plenty of sailboats and pleasure crafts.

We had some free time to walk around the port and snap a few photos.

Next, we had about 30 minutes to visit the 2 bays in Villa La Angostura: Bahia Brava, meaning ‘wild bay’ due to its choppy waters, and Bahia Mansa, meaning ‘calm bay’.

The two bays are located across from each other, and you can walk from one to the other in 5 minutes, so be sure to visit both!

Lunch at El Esquiador

Our tour did not include lunch, which was actually a great thing because there are so many great restaurants and breweries in the town of Villa La Angostura, and it's nice to be able to choose where you want to eat!

Since we had already spent a few days in Villa La Angostura earlier in our Patagonia trip, we knew we wanted to go back to our favourite restaurant: El Esquiador, meaning ‘the skier’.

This is a bodegón-style restaurant, and in Argentina, that means classic dishes, large portions, and no-frills dining.

If you’re interested in trying a local Patagonian dish, you cannot go wrong with their hunter’s stew with deer, potatoes and mushrooms.

Pair that with a bottle of Argentine wine, preferably a Malbec or Cabernet Sauvignon and you’ve got yourself an exquisite meal!

For dessert, we had the flan with dulce de leche - a classic Argentine staple.

Afterwards, we had a bit of time to enjoy Villa La Angostura before meeting up with our group again, so we went for a walk down the main promenade, which is lined with souvenir shops, chocolate shops, and all sorts of cafes and restaurants.

This is a super charming town and really worth a longer visit if you're travelling through northern Patagonia.

And then, it was time to drive back to the town of San Martín de los Andes, where we started the excursion.

Here's the video of our experience visiting the Route of the Seven Lakes on a guided tour:

If you grew up watching the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) then you already know who we're talking about. If you didn't, then you probably have a lot of questions:

Who was Butch Cassidy? Why is he so famous in Patagonia? And why should I bother visiting his ranch?

Yes, this is one of the more unusual places you can visit in Chubut, but it's an attraction that locals are proud to preserve.

So if you want to learn how a small out-of-the-way community in Northern Patagonia ended up with links to a robber from the American Wild West, read on because it's a fascinating story.

We'll also tell you how to reach Butch Cassidy's ranch and we'll share a few other noteworthy places you won't want to miss.

Who was Butch Cassidy?

Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch were a group of outlaws who operated during the Wild West era of the American frontier. They were prolific train robbers and bank robbers whose careers as criminals eventually caught up with them.

With law enforcement hot on their trail, Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and the Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place, decided they needed to get far, far away.

Using fake identities, they boarded a British steamer called the Herminius and fled the United States. Their destination: Buenos Aires, Argentina.

From there, they made their way south, all the way down to Patagonia, where they purchased land and bought cattle, sheep and horses. They lived in a four-room cabin, and it is said they were trying to live honest lives.

However, when two English-speaking bandits held up the Banco de Tarapacá y Argentino in Río Gallegos, some 1,500 kilometres south of Cholila, it might as well have been them. The robbery netted $100,000 USD in today's currency, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were prime suspects.

It turns out the Pinkerton Detective Agency was hot on their trail and had been for quite some time; they were just waiting for winter in Patagonia to pass so they could make their move!

A local Argentine-Welsh sheriff who was friendly with the group tipped them off, giving them just enough time to sell their ranch before fleeing to Bariloche and then onwards to Chile.

It is said that Etta Place had gotten tired of life on the run and was also mourning the loss of their ranch in Patagonia, so the Sundance Kid accompanied her back to California.

Meanwhile, Butch Cassidy obtained work at a mine in the Bolivian Andes and was joined by the Kid on his return.

The two eventually met their end in Bolivia at a shootout a few days after their final robbery.

As for their ranch, by the 1990s it had fallen into a state of disrepair and was just about ready to collapse.

In 2007, the cabin was restored turning it into a rather obscure tourist attraction in Patagonia.

How to find Butch Cassidy's Ranch

So how do you get to Butch Cassidy's ranch in Cholila?

Let's keep in mind that Butch Cassidy did not want to be found, so reaching his ranch is an adventure in and of itself in off-the-beaten-path Patagonia.

The ranch is not particularly close to any major town or city, so if you want to get there, you're going to need a car. It's a 2-hour drive from Esquel or a 1-hour drive from El Bolsón.

The ranch is located in rural Patagonia and the nearest community is Cholila about 10 kilometres to the south. If we're being technical about it, the ranch is located in the rural commune of Cushamen, but there's nothing there save for a few ranches, so Cholila is the place to look for. However, if you reach Cholila you've gone too far.

Driving on Ruta Nacional 40 (the highway that crosses the length of Argentina from north to south), you'll want to turn off on Ruta Provincial 71.

About 20 kilometres into your drive on RP71, you'll notice a bar on the right-hand side called Museo Bar: La Legal. This is where you'll pull over.

If the building is open, this is where you go in and pay an admission fee to visit 'el rancho'. If it is not open, you backtrack to the previous dirt road you passed on the right-hand side (now on your left).

Right away, you'll see a trail. This is where you leave your car, and follow the path on foot until you reach a collection of wooden buildings in the middle of a field.

Inside Butch Cassidy's Cabin

So what's it like inside the cabin that was inhabited by Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kit and Etta Place?

Surprisingly, once you set foot in the cabin, there's nothing there.

The rooms are bare, save for some engravings on the wall left by either trespassers or tourists.

But as you walk around, you can imagine what a simple life the trio would've had - while it lasted.

They were living in a log cabin on the east bank of the Blanco River with mountains as far as the eye can see.

They had been granted 15,000 acres of adjacent land to develop, 2,500 acres of which belonged to Place, who had the distinction of being the first woman rancher in Argentina to own land under a new act (land ownership had previously been denied to women).

One has to imagine their life was good, but there was no outrunning their past...or their crimes.

Visiting the Butch Cassidy Museum

Now, let's go back to the building where we mentioned you need to pull over to reach Butch Cassidy's ranch.

Museo Bar: La Legal is a cafe, bar, museum and outpost all rolled into one.

It's set up like a general store from centuries past with floor-to-ceiling shelving showcasing all sorts of antiques. There are damajuana wine bottles (the ones that hold 5 litres), collectible televisions and radios, legal tender that is no longer used in Argentina, and so much more! You almost don't know where to look.

On the main wall, as soon as you enter, you have a small souvenir section with items for sale. Here you can find local wines, Patagonian craft beer, jams, and even books that tell the story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Then, over to the right-hand side, you have a bar with freshly baked cakes and pastries on display. There's also an espresso machine, and you can order all sorts of beverages like beer, wine and smoothies. Plus, there's also a daily menu with whatever they happen to be cooking that day.

There's another room to the left that has been set up as a museum of sorts, showcasing all things Butch Cassidy and the Wild Gang.

They have wanted posters, photographs, maps of the ranch and the surrounding area, snippets of history, and even some cowboy hats and pistols for photo ops.

At the time of publication, the hours of operation for Museo Bar: La Legal are 11:00 to 14:00 and 16:00 to 20:00. However, their schedule is seasonal and they do not open year-round. It's best to check their Instagram page @museobar_lalegal for the most up-to-date information!

Butch Cassidy in Trelew

Another popular stop for those who are on the Butch Cassidy trail is Trelew.

Trelew is a small city situated in northeastern Chubut, so on the complete opposite side of the province (six and a half hours by car from Cholila, in case you're wondering!)

One of the main attractions in Trelew is Hotel Touring Club, which also has links to the famous gang.

The hotel has been declared part of the natural and cultural heritage of Trelew. It was built in 1898 and at one point was considered one of the most luxurious hotels in all of Argentina.

During the 1930s, it hosted presidents, politicians, sports figures and illustrious writers like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of The Little Prince.

Well, the American outlaws Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Etta Place were also among the guests at Hotel Touring Club.

Through the courtyard, in the back of the hotel, there's a room called 'Los Bandoleros' or 'The Bandits', which is where Butch Cassidy and his gang are believed to have stayed.

The room is frozen in time and features Butch Cassidy memorabilia on the walls, so if you're going to be in the area, that's another stop you can add to the list.

As a side note, if you do decide to make it over to Trelew, you should consider visiting Puerto Madryn and Península Valdés for wildlife viewing opportunities and the town of Gaiman for a dose of Welsh culture in Patagonia.

We told you there's lots to see in Chubut!

Final thoughts on the ranch

Is it a bit strange to visit an attraction that centres around an outlaw who was known for robbing trains and banks?

Yes, yes it is.

But it's also part of the local history that is being preserved, plus it brings tourism to a very rural and under-visited corner of Patagonia.

At the end of the day, the choice is yours, but now you have all the information you need to reach Butch Cassidy's ranch if you decide to visit.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,373c86070de28bd82d82348d3f1de9a569d013f0
71849b8f96f1b9c4e7c36916ee9c9b8ee095d68f,che_argentina_travel,en,The Old Patagonian Express: An Epic Train Journey in Patagonia!,"Argentina is home to many epic train journeys, but perhaps none is more famous than the Old Patagonian Express!

The train is locally known as La Trochita, meaning ‘little gauge’ because it's a narrow gauge railway that’s only 750 mm wide or about 2 feet 5 and a half inches.

This heritage train showcases the ruggedness of Patagonia, and along the journey, passengers can expect to be treated to epic views of mountains, valleys, and Patagonian steppe. It truly is one of the highlights of a visit to Chubut!

Today, La Trochita may only operate a short portion of the original 402-kilometre route it once covered, however, it captures the nostalgia of 20th-century train travel.

That alone makes it worth adding to your northern Patagonia travel itinerary!

History of the Old Patagonian Express

The Old Patagonian Express once stretched out 402 kilometres, and it was originally planned as part of a larger network that would connect all of Patagonia. However, the project was never completed due to ministerial changes and then the start of the First World War, which also affected Argentina’s economy.

Its use eventually began to decline as road systems improved, and because part of the railway network was never completed, it left this line isolated and disconnected from the rest of the country.

But then things changed when Paul Theroux published his book The Old Patagonian Express in 1978.

In his book, Theroux set out to travel by train from his hometown in Massachusetts all the way down to Argentina, and clearly the Patagonia leg of his journey made quite the impression because it earned the book's title!

Travellers suddenly began to take an interest in the Old Patagonian Express, and that brings us to the train journey as we know it today.

Today the train operates on alternating locomotives; one is a Baldwin from the United States and the other a Henschel from Germany. The wooden wagons came from Belgium, and the heaters were installed in Argentina to make the journeys across Patagonia in winter a little more bearable.

How to ride the Old Patagonian Express

There are three segments of the Old Patagonian Express for travellers to choose from - though some are more frequent than others:

Esquel to Nahuel Pan - 18 kilometres

El Maitén to Desvío Bruno Thomaé - 26 kilometres

Ingeniero Jacobacci to Ojos de Agua - 42 kilometres

Before you plan your train journey, it’s best to check an updated schedule on the official La Trochita website since some routes aren’t in operation year-round.

Esquel to Nahuel Pan

The most popular route runs from Esquel to Nahuel Pan and it’s a beautiful journey. As you leave the town of Esquel, you begin the ascent out of the valley where you are treated to mountain views and sheep grazing in the Patagonian steppe.

You’ll notice this is the shortest of the three segments in terms of distance covered, however, this train journey involves an ascent out of town, so it travels a bit slower.

It is a 1-hour journey from Esquel to Nahuel Pan.

Once you arrive in Nahuel Pan, you have 45 minutes to explore at your own leisure.

Here you can visit the Museum of Patagonian Culture, which focuses on the indigenous peoples of Patagonia. It’s a small museum with only two rooms, but the displays showcase ceramics, musical instruments and textiles. If you speak Spanish, you can also ask questions to the museum guide on site.

The highlight of our brief stop in Nahuel Pan was the artisanal fair. Vendors had set up booths showcasing all sorts of handmade souvenirs, and we were immediately drawn to the alfajores with fillings like dulce de leche, raspberry, Welsh-inspired Bara brith, and rum and raisin.

There was also a man cooking chorizos on the grill, so we got some choripán (chorizo on a bread bun) with chimichurri. It’s worth lining up for this right away, as it’s a popular food stop.

On the journey back, there was live music on the train. A local musician made his way through the carriages singing and playing songs on his guitar as we travelled back to Esquel.

El Maitén to Desvío Bruno Thomaé

Another option for train enthusiasts is to travel the segment from El Maitén to Desvío Bruno Thomaé.

This is a 26-kilometre journey across the Patagonian steppe. The journey is relatively flat, however, you do get mountain views on the horizon.

It’s worth arriving early in order to visit the Railway Museum and tour the Locomotive Repair Shop. This is a guided visit that’s included in the ticket price, and it’s a great opportunity to ask questions about this historic train (albeit in Spanish).

We heard stories about the extreme weather in Patagonia and how, when the train is scheduled to do its weekly outing in winter, sometimes they have to get it running 2 days ahead of time!

We also learned that when a working component of the Old Patagonian Express breaks down, workers have to handcraft a new part since the train is so old that spare parts are no longer produced industrially.

The fact that this train is still running is a true testament to the ingenuity of the workers!

Now, if we compare this journey with the one from Esquel to Nahuel Pan, the major difference is that when you arrive in Desvío Bruno Thomaé, there’s nothing there apart from a train station that was burned down by a Mapuche protest. So there’s nothing to see or do (no artisanal market like in Nahuel Pan) while you wait for the train to reposition for the return journey.

Ingeniero Jacobacci to Ojos de Agua

Ingeniero Jacobacci to Ojos de Agua is the least frequent and lesser known of the three train segments you can travel aboard the Old Patagonian Express.

In fact, this route was closed for a long time and only recently reopened, while also providing connections to make this journey a bit more accessible.

Getting there involves either driving in from Bariloche (a 3-hour drive) or joining a guided tour departing from Bariloche to Ingeniero Jacobacci.

It is then a 2-hour train journey from Ingeniero Jacobacci to Ojos de Agua.

Upon arrival, passengers have about 1 hour and 15 minutes to enjoy a meal and walk around. The train then returns to Ingeniero Jacobacci via the same route.

How to book train tickets

How do you book tickets for the Old Patagonian Express?

Here are a few different options:

Booking in person

If you’re already planning to be in one of the towns the train departs from (Esquel, El Maitén or Ingeniero Jacobacci), the easiest option is to go to the train station and buy them in person. However, be mindful of each train station's hours of operation, which are limited.

If you’re visiting during low season, you may be able to get a ticket on the same day, but this isn’t advised during high season when every last seat on the train can be sold out.

Booking through a tour operator

If you want to avoid the hassle of going to the train station and booking in person, the best thing to do is to book through a local tour operator.

If doesn't matter if you're in Bariloche or El Bolsón, you can walk into almost any tour operator and book this excursion through them. This will often also include transportation to and from the departure station.

So hit the streets and walk into some offices. Just try to do so earlier in your trip since the train departures are not daily, especially outside of high season.

Booking online

If you prefer to book online, you can do so directly on the official La Trochita website by clicking 'Comprá tu ticket'. This will open another window where you can select your journey, date and departure time. You'll then be presented with a list of fares and will want to click 'Internacional' if you're an international tourist. Next, you'll select your seats and choose your payment method.

You can also buy tickets online at Tren Patagónico Official Website by scrolling down to La Trochita. But be very careful you don't book the Tren Patagónico, which is an overnight train journey that crosses the country from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean!

This isn't the easiest website to navigate, so I'd only recommend it if you can read Spanish and understand the steps outlined on how to book the correct segment of the journey. In our experience, this website can sometimes be glitchy, which is why we recommend booking in person or via a tour operator.

And that’s how you book a trip aboard the Old Patagonian Express!

The journey may be a fraction of what it once was, but it’s an adventure nevertheless and worth adding to your list of places to visit in Patagonia, Argentina.

Even though this steam train covers a short distance, it’s a fun way to experience the magical landscapes of the Patagonian steppe.

Now over to you. Are you a train enthusiast? Would you like to travel aboard the Old Patagonian Express?

When we first told Argentines we were travelling to the oil town of Comodoro Rivadavia in Patagonia, we got some wide eyes and plenty of whys.

“There’s nothing to see there.”

“Why would you want to go to an oil town?”

“It’s just sand and wind down there!”

These were some of the things we heard about Comodoro Rivadavia. Yet admittedly, most of the people telling us these things had never been there!

That piqued our curiosity and so, we took it upon ourselves to add Comodoro Rivadavia to our coastal Patagonia travel plans and see what the city had to offer.

After all, this is the biggest city in the Province of Chubut!

History of oil in Comodoro Rivadavia

The story of how oil was discovered in Comodoro Rivadavia is a little murky. Popular narrative says a team was drilling for water and they got lucky and struck oil instead, but that isn’t quite how things unfolded.

But first, let’s set the scene. Comodoro Rivadavia was founded by decree in 1901 as a port for the inland settlement of Sarmiento.

The early settlers were Boers and Welsh immigrants who worked in agriculture. One of the challenges they faced was a shortage of water, which required them to haul water by oxen. It was supposedly at the insistence of these settlers that drilling for water began and that's how they found oil.

Except this does not line up with any of the events that unfolded.

In 1903, the National Mining, Geology and Hydrology Department sent down a rig to supposedly drill a water well. The problem with this story is that you don’t drill for water at the depths this team was drilling.

The first perforation went down 172 metres and no water was found. Now just to give you some context, water in this area can be found at a depth of 50-100 metres!

They kind of overshot the mark a bit, don't you think?

Then in 1906, a team of German engineers was assembled and a new rig was sent down for a second attempt at drilling for ‘water’. Two of the key figures on site were Humberto Beghin in charge of operations and José Fuchs in charge of drilling. This was organized by Julio Krause, Head of Drilling of Argentina’s Mining Department whose involvement already raises some questions.

Plus, do you really bring a whole team over from Germany just to drill for water?

This second perforation reached a depth of 500 metres and still no ‘water’.

But then, a change in fortune. On December 12, 1907 an oily substance started bubbling out - it smelled of kerosene.

The following day on December 13, the drilling team reached a depth of 540 metres and declared the discovery of oil. A telegram was immediately sent to the President alerting him of the news and the rest is history.

That’s how Argentina’s oil capital of Comodoro Rivadavia was born!

Things to do in Comodoro Rivadavia

So what are some things to do in Comodoro Rivadavia?

Admittedly, many of the attractions in town revolve around petroleum - this is an oil town after all!

However, this seaside destination also offers excellent seafood, cool lookout points, and easy day trips to a beach town and a sea lion colony.

So in this blog post, we'll be giving you a few ideas of what you can do during your visit.

Visit the National Petroleum Museum

The most important place to visit in Comodoro Rivadavia is the National Petroleum Museum, locally known as Museo Nacional del Petróleo.

This is the place to learn about the first discovery of oil and the role it played in making Comodoro Rivadavia what it is today.

The museum is located in the General Mosconi neighbourhood about 3 kilometres north of the city centre. It is built in the very spot where the teams first struck oil.

The nice thing about this museum is that there is a guide on site to share the history of oil in Comodoro Rivadavia and answer any questions you may have.

You are also free to explore the museum at your own pace and there’s quite a bit to see between the outdoor and indoor components.

Outside you can visit the second perforation where they struck oil and you can also view all of the machinery that was used to drill to such great depths.

Then indoors, you can go into this simulator that shows you what it would be like if you could shrink down and travel to the bottom of an oil well. I’m sure it’s an experience meant for children, but it was actually a lot of fun!

They also have interesting displays that show you what petroleum can look like (all sorts of surprising colours!), photos of the National Oil Queen pageant, and exhibits on the uses of oil through time dating from the Middle Ages to Ancient Egypt.

Enjoy the views from Cerro Chenque

Another thing to do in Comodoro Rivadavia is to enjoy the views from Cerro Chenque.

It’s impossible to miss this hill as it dominates the cityscape. It rises 212 metres above sea level and offers great panoramic views of the city and the coastline facing south.

The name ‘chenque’ means cemetery or grave in the native Pehuenche language, since this was used as a burial ground.

While it is possible to walk up Cerro Chenque, it is a busy road shared with heavy traffic and you have to walk along a gravel path on the side.

If it’s just the views you’re after, you can hire a taxi to drive you to the top and wait for you while you snap some photos before driving back down.

If you prefer to walk from the city centre, the easiest way to do so is by taking Ruta del Centenario on the west end of the hill and then coming back down the same way once you’ve reached the viewpoint.

Visit the other museums

Aside from the National Petroleum Museum, which is the main attraction in town, there are a few smaller museums scattered across Comodoro Rivadavia. But again, I emphasize these are very small and have very limited hours of operation. So you'll want to check each museum's schedule online before you attempt to visit:

Railway Port Museum

Patagonian Regional Museum

Museum of Mining and Geology

Military Historical Museum

Museum of Paleontology Astra

We tried visiting three different ones on this list, but only one of them was open!

Walk along the Costanera

Comodoro Rivadavia is a seaside city and that means you can enjoy some beautiful coastal walks along the Costanera.

We did the walk along Playa Costanera, starting at Plaza Soberanía and heading north along the coast. You go through a bit of an industrial shipping area where you can see some old abandoned boats covered in graffiti, and you eventually reach the beach.

The coastal walk then continues along these towering cliffs. If you do this walk on a sunny day when the light turns the waters turquoise, you almost feel like you’ve been transported over to the Caribbean!

Take a day trip to Rada Tilly

Another thing to do during your visit to Comodoro Rivadavia, is to take a day trip to Rada Tilly.

Rada Tilly is a beach town located just 13 kilometres from Comodoro Rivadavia and it’s considered a weekend getaway and summer destination for those with oil money.

The waterfront is lined with elegant homes and mansions - some that look like they were inspired by Santorini! - and the beach is right on their doorstep.

During low tide, the beach is incredibly wide and you can walk all the way down to the cliffs on the south end of the beach looking for shells.

The beach is also a popular destination for windsurfing, kitesurfing, and even landsailing - a sport where three-wheeled carts with a sail attached to them move with the force of the wind.

Rada Tilly feels a bit more upscale than neighbouring Comodoro Rivadavia, but it still maintains a casual beach town feel, so if you want to see something a little different this day trip is worth it.

See sea lions at Punta Marqués

Another popular day trip from Comodoro Rivadavia is to Punta Marqués to see sea lions.

If Península Valdés in northeastern Chubut isn't on your itinerary this time around, then you can get your dose of wildlife viewing here.

Punta Marqués is a 19-kilometre drive from Comodoro Rivadavia or a 6-kilometre drive from Rada Tilly.

You can easily get there by car if you're planning on renting one, or otherwise, you can reach the point by taxi. Here's a map of how to get there.

This natural reserve is an opportunity for visitors to see the sea lions that live on the cliffs year-round, though you'll find the highest concentration of them from October to December.

Where to eat in Comodoro Rivadavia

Cayo Coco del Mar

Our favourite restaurant which we visited multiple times over the course of our trip was Cayo Coco del Mar.

This seaside restaurant is located on Playa Costanera and it looks out over the ocean. Of course, we had to try the seafood!

We really enjoyed their seafood platter featuring calamari, shrimp casserole, breaded fish, mussels and more. It was a mix of hot and cold dishes and a nice option if you want to try a bit of everything on the menu.

We then went back to try their paella and seafood stew, so we sampled a good part of their menu!

Puerto Mitre

This pizza restaurant came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.

They have an interesting list of Patagonian pizzas featuring regional ingredients. Especial del Mar has shrimp, Del Lago has smoked trout, Brama has smoked deer and so on.

We opted for their shrimp pizza and let me tell you, these were plump shrimp!

We paired the meal with a bottle of wine and were very happy with our selection.

Cayo Coco

I can only imagine this restaurant must be affiliated to the seaside restaurant Cayo Coco del Mar?

While the former focused on seafood, this one was all about classic Argentine favourites. That means pizza, pasta and parrilla (BBQ)!

Because this place was so close to our hotel we ended up eating here a couple of times.

We opted for pizza (surprise, surprise!) and also tried their shrimp salad with avocado and palm hearts. And we were also very into the flambéed pancakes!

Chocolates

You might think this is a chocolate shop based on its name, but it's also an ice cream parlour and cafe serving up cakes and specialty coffees.

The place also has an arcade and a random carousel, so it's popular with families with young children.

We opted for some artesanal ice cream and tried their coconut with dulce de leche, which was amazing!

When in Argentina you always order at least one scoop of dulce de leche - a creamy, caramel spread made by slowly heating sugar and milk over several hours.

Where to stay in Comodoro Rivadavia

Because this is an oil town that sees a lot of people travelling for business, Comodoro Rivadavia has a nice selection of business hotels with buffet breakfast and fast internet. Here are a few options to consider:

Comodoro Hotel - 3-star hotel, centrally located with a lobby bar and buffet breakfast. This is where we stayed!

Lucania Palazzo Hotel - 4-star hotel featuring bright and spacious rooms, a piano bar, gym and sauna.

Austral Hotel - 4-star hotel with an in-house restaurant specializing in seafood dishes and regional cuisine.

How to get to Comodoro Rivadavia

By air

The easiest way to reach Comodoro Rivadavia is by air. There are multiple direct flights from Buenos Aires every day, as well as select flights arriving from Ushuaia, Trelew, Neuquén and Córdoba.

From Buenos Aires, you're looking at a travel time of 2 hours and 25 minutes.

By bus

Comodoro Rivadavia is well connected by bus and the journeys aren't that long if you consider some of the epic overnight bus journeys to cross Patagonia.

If you're coming from Puerto Madryn in the north it's 5 hours and 30 minutes, from Esquel in the west it's 9 hours, and from Rio Gallegos in the south it's 10 hours and 20 minutes.

Maybe consider upgrading your bus seat so you can travel in comfort. You can choose from Semicama (half-bed), Cama-Ejecutivo (executive bed) and Cama Suite (bed suite).

Final thoughts on Comodoro Rivadavia

That concludes our visit to Comodoro Rivadavia.

Are we glad we visited?

Yes!

Is it everyone's cup of tea?

No.

Like with many frontier cities, Comodoro Rivadavia can have a bit of a rough feel, but the people were warm, the attractions were interesting, and the seafood was amazing! So we had a good time.

As I've mentioned before, we enjoy travelling to off the beaten path destinations and visiting places that aren't necessarily on everyone's travel radar, so if that matches your travel style, then consider visiting Comodoro Rivadavia.

If you're doing an epic overland journey across the length of Patagonia, this destination is also a nice way to break up the trip.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,620e33c7580348a3428b5c303e59ec063bdbd311

El Bolson lies in a valley surrounded by jagged mountain ranges on either side, the local architecture features lots of log cabin-style buildings, and the town itself has a very easy-going and laid-back feel.

The main draw to El Bolson is its pristine nature, of course! There are hiking trails that meander up the rocky mountains, swimming holes with turquoise waters, and cascading waterfalls tucked away in the woodland. It's every outdoor lover's paradise!

This town is one of the most beautiful places in Patagonia and in this El Bolson travel guide, we're going to be sharing some of the highlights!

How to get to El Bolson

So, where is El Bolson?

El Bolson is located in the Province of Río Negro in Northern Patagonia.

The nearest airport is in the city of San Carlos de Bariloche, which is 2 hours or 138 kilometres north of El Bolson.

If you're planning a Northern Patagonia road trip, then renting a car is the best way to get to El Bolson and thoroughly explore the area.

Alternatively, there are buses that connect Bariloche with El Bolson, or Esquel with El Bolson if you're arriving from the south.

Via Bariloche has multiple departures per day and offers a good service.

Is El Bolson worth visiting?

Absolutely! El Bolson is one of our favourite mountain towns in Patagonia and we think it's worth a spot on your Patagonia itinerary.

If you want to experience Patagonia off-the-beaten-path, enjoy spending time in nature, being surrounded by mountains, visiting craft breweries, and indulging your sweet tooth in artisanal ice creams and chocolates, then you're going to enjoy what El Bolson has to offer.

How long should you stay in El Bolson?

Ideally, you'd want to spend at least 3 days in El Bolson in order to cover the main attractions and enjoy some of the local day hikes.

With 5-7 days you could add on some of the day trips which include a national park, neighbouring lakeside towns, and even a ride aboard a very famous train.

That being said, if you are pressed for time, there is a day tour to El Bolson from Bariloche, which also includes a visit to Lago Puelo National Park. That's something to consider if you're visiting Bariloche for a few days.

You'll only be able to cover a handful of attractions in the town with one day, but it'll give you a taste of El Bolson.

Things to do in El Bolson

There are lots of things to do in El Bolson and as you'd expect from a mountain town, most of these activities are outdoors.

That means epic mountain views all around!

Bosque Tallado

One of the more unique attractions to visit in El Bolsón is the Carved Forest, also known as Bosque Tallado.

This sculpture forest is located on Cerro Piltriquitrón at 1,420 meters above sea level, and it came to be after a series of fires burnt down part of the mountainside.

Marcelo López, a local artist, came up with the idea of inviting fellow artists to come and use the burnt and fallen lenga trees as their canvas.

These sculpture-carving gatherings were organized in 1998, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2014 adding new sculptures to the forest every few years.

Aside from the artwork, the Sculpture Forest is a beautiful day hike that offers impressive views of the town of El Bolsón and the surrounding mountains!

Feria Artesanal

El Bolsón is well known for its Feria Artesanal or artisanal hippie fair that sets up in Plaza Pagano every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.

There are around 200 stalls selling ceramics, leather, tapestries, candles, honey, jams and even natural cosmetics.

Plus, we can’t forget all the food trucks where you can sample empanadas, choripán, crêpes, hamburgers and more.

Monte Viejo Artesanías

This shop sells beautiful Argentine handicrafts, and it's the ideal place to pick up some classic Argentinian souvenirs.

They have jewellery made by local artists, including the owner of the store himself.

You can also find mates and bombillas, gaucho hats, knit vests, ceramics, ponchos and wool sweaters.

The staff are also incredibly sweet and friendly, so it's a nice place to shop.

Hiking in El Bolsón

El Bolsón is a great hiking destination and there are numerous trails to choose from all ranging in length and level of difficulty. A few to consider include:

Cerro Amigo - This is an easy hike that leads to 3 different lookout points offering town and mountain views. (2 kms, 30 mins)

Cascada Escondida - The hidden waterfall is accessed via the Botanical Garden and it's a short and easy trail. (1,4 km, 25 mins)

Cerro Piltriquitrón - This is the most iconic mountain in El Bolson and its name means ‘hanging from the clouds’. The hiking trails leads up to a mountain refuge where you can spend the night or at the very least enjoy a meal. Be warned, it is a steep hike! (9.3 kms, 5 h)

Cabeza del Indio - This hike leads to a lookout of the valley where you can see the Río Azul and there’s also a rock that resembles a human head. (6.8 kms, 2 h 15 mins)

El Cajón del Azul - This hiking trail starts at the Wharton Farm and leads you to a forested river canyon with crystalline waters that range from turquoise to emerald. It's a popular summer destination to enjoy a swim, and the trail can also be done as part of a horseback riding tour. (17.4 kms, 5 h 45 mins)

You can find a complete list of hiking trails in El Bolsón on the All Trails website.

Day trips from El Bolson

There are so many fun day trips you can enjoy from El Bolsón - all of them featuring spectacular nature.

Also fun fact, the day trips listed below are all in the Province of Chubut! El Bolsón is located in the Province of Río Negro, but it is so close to the border with Chubut, that it's super easy to cross over and explore.

Lago Puelo

One of my personal favourite trips from El Bolsón is to Lago Puelo, which is located only 30 minutes south of town.

Lago Puelo is both a town and a national park. First you'll pass through town, and then you'll reach the park which is name after the lake.

This park offers lots of hiking trails with incredible lookout points where you can admire the beauty of Lake Puelo.

There are also boat tours that allow you to experience some of the park highlights and even hike to the Chilean border.

During the summer season, food trucks park close to the beach so you can enjoy a picnic with a view.

Cholila

Another easy day trip from El Bolsón is the Cholila Ranch that was once home to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

These two outlaws earned themselves quite the reputation as bank and train robbers in the days of the American Wild West.

After law enforcement got a little too hot on their trail, they decided to escape to Patagonia.

Here they purchased land and bought cattle, however, they couldn't outrun their past. When the Pinkerton Detective Agency tracked them down, a local sheriff gave them the heads up so they could get out of dodge.

Butch Cassidy's Ranch is located just under 1 hour south of El Bolsón.

Getting there involves driving along National Route 40 and then turning west on Provincial Route 71. It's then on the right hand side just 10 kilometres outside the town of Cholila.

El Hoyo

Another day trip from El Bolsón to consider is El Hoyo.

This is only a 40-minute drive south of El Bolsón along National Route 40.

One of the main attractions in El Hoyo is Laberinto Patagonia, the largest labyrinth in South America! It sits on a 5-hectare estate and has 2,200 metres worth of paths. They also have a wonderful tea house on site with the most scrumptious cakes.

If wineries are more your thing, you'll be glad to hear that El Hoyo has a growing wine scene. A few to visit include Patagonian Wines, Bodega y Viñedos Ayestarán, and Allard Mammarelli Wines.

Epuyén

Another relatively short and easy day trip from El Bolsón is to Epuyén, just a 40-minute drive south of El Bolsón.

This town is best known for Lago Epuyen, a lake of glacial origins with crystalline blue waters that look out of this world.

People come to a point on the lake known as Puerto Patriada to enjoy a lakeside picnic with a bit of hiking, or even some kayaking.

Epuyén also has a buddhist stuppa, which with the surrounding mountain peaks, will make you feel like you've been transported to Nepal.

Plus it has a brewery and restaurants, so you won't go thirsty or hungry.

El Maitén

El Maitén is a popular day trip from El Bolsón for those wanting to ride aboard the Old Patagonian Express.

While the most famous train route is the one that runs from Esquel to Nahuel Pan, there is another segment that runs from El Maitén to Desvío Bruno Thomaé.

This is a 26 kilometre train journey across the Patagonian steppe.

It’s also worth arriving at the train station early in order to visit the Railway Museum and tour the Locomotive Repair Shop.

You can reserve this excursion at Grado 42, a tour agency that's located right in the centre of town on Avenida San Martín.

Where to stay in El Bolson

El Bolson is no longer the quiet, sleepy, hippie mountain town it once was.

In fact, it draws its fair share of travellers during the summer months when the town's population dramatically soares!

That also means there's no shortage of accommodations, whether you're looking for log cabins or a guesthouse, a geodesic dome or a hobbit home, you can find it all here!

La Aguada - high-end accommodations with mountain views, a swimming pool and a garden, all at the foot of Cerro Piltriquitron.

Casas Chaura - artsy two-story cabins that can fit 2-5 people, located just 6 blocks from the centre of town.

Hostel Cosmo - large family home turned cozy, rustic hostel with a nice garden right downtown!

Camping La Cascada - cool campsite in the outskirts of town next to the botanic garden and waterfall, featuring hobbit homes, tiny cabins, as well as campsites.

Where to eat in El Bolson

A Gusto

If you're travelling in Argentina and you're not vegetarian, you'll want to try the local cuisine, namely asado or parrillada. These names refer to an assortment of cuts of meat cooked on the grill over coals.

A Gusto in El Bolson does grilled meats very, very well!

Try their tablas de carne or meat platters to share. The tabla criolla features some classic cuts like rib eye steak, sirloin steak, pork sausage and blood sausage.

Either make a reservation or show up as soon as they open at 7pm - no Argentine would dine at this gringo hour, so you're almost guaranteed to get a table!

Address: Dorrego 539

Los Lúpulos

This restaurants does amazing pizzas and the best part is that they let you mix and match, so you can choose two different styles on one pizza.

The 'Los Lúpulos Pizza' with tomato sauce, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, Patagonian cheeses and olives was one of our favourites.

Address: Avenida San Martín 2740

El Tablón

This place specializes in pizzas and empanadas. We only tried the empanadas, but they were so good that we came back for more!

A few fillings to try include pancetta y ciruela (bacon and plum), carne cortada a cuchilla (cubed meat with a juicy sauce), and roquefort (blue cheese).

You can dine indoors or on the patio, but they also do take-out in case you're craving a quiet evening and just want to eat back at your place.

Address: Avenida San Martín 2467

Awka Cervecería

Next up, there's Awka Cervecería, a local craft brewery in El Bolson.

What do you feel like drinking? Golden, Kolsh, American IPA, Honey, Oatmeal, Barleywine? They've got it all!

Pair that with a juicy hamburger and a side of loaded potatoes with melted cheddar cheese, bacon and spring onions, and you've got yourself a great meal.

Grab a seat in the outdoor patio, enjoy the music, and soak in the magic of a cool Patagonian evening.

Address: Perito Moreno and Dorrego

Patio Cervecero

This is a popular gathering place in El Bolson to have a few craft beers. They have blonds, reds, stouts, IPAs, honey and even raspberry beers on tap.

You can find a lot of classic Argentine dishes on the menu like milanesa al caballo, a breaded veal cutlet served with ham, cheese, and two fried eggs on top and a mountain of French fries on the side.

Frankfurters with chucrut, and Goulash with Spätzle are a few of their popular dishes.

Basically, hearty and filling food that pairs well with beer!

They offer outdoor seating on a patio as well as indoor seating.

Address: Avenida San Martin and Padre Feliciano

Helados Jauja

Patagonia is known for its artesanal ice creams, and in El Bolson, Helados Jauja is the place to go!

With flavours like Andean chocolate with walnuts, dulce de leche with brownies, and calafate berries with sheep's milk, there's plenty of temptation!

While Jauja has several locations across Patagonia, in El Bolson they also have an onsite cafe where you can enjoy more than just ice cream.

Their menu features sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, cakes, smoothies and a variety of teas and coffees.

Address: Avenida San Martín 2867

Café Paseo de las Flores

Café Paseo de Las Flores looks like something straight out of the shire. It seriously would not look out of place if a hobbit wandered out the front door.

The cafe set in a beautiful secret garden surrounded by all sorts of potted plants, cacti and blooms.

They only open in the afternoons, but it's the ideal place for an afternoon coffee or tea with a nice slice of cake.

In fact, they have a very fancy coffee menu featuring all sorts of concoctions. Want to add Fernet to your coffee? How about some Irish whisky? Or some rum for a more tropical feel? You can get as creative as you like!

Distance: 24 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 1,068 metres

The hike to Laguna de los Tres is one of the most spectacular treks in El Chaltén and for good reason! It leads up to this beautiful glacial lagoon with a glacier and three towering peaks in the background. 

The name Laguna de los Tres translates to 'Lagoon of the Three' and it refers to the three peaks you see behind the lagoon: Fitz Roy (3,405 metres), Poincenot (3,002 metres), and Saint-Exupéry (2,558 metres).

The round trip to Laguna de los Tres is approximately 24 kilometres (14.9 miles). Yes, it is a hardcore day of trekking! The duration of the hike will vary depending on your pace and level of fitness, but it generally takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete.

Laguna de los Tres is considered a challenging hike, not just because of the distance, but because the final kilometre is a steep ascent up a rocky slope that will make you question your choices. Trekking poles are a good idea for this trek.

I was so tempted to throw in the towel and turn around on that final kilometre - I had already been walking for hours, I was tired, and that final climb didn't look like a whole lot of fun. But it was the encouragement from the people trekking down and telling us, ""It'll be so worth it!"" that kept us motivated. 

Well, once we finally made it over the ridge, it really was all worth it and the effort it took to get there was quickly forgotten. We were rewarded with the most pristine glacial lagoon shimmering a deep blue, a glacier winding down the side of the mountain, and clouds blowing over Mount Fitz Roy and its neighbouring peaks. 

We sought shelter behind a boulder (it was windy up there!), stared at the incredible views in front of us, devoured what we had left of our packed lunch, and gathered our energy for the steep descent and walk back to El Chalten. 

I realize Laguna de los Tres may not be for everyone, considering how demanding it is, so this next trek is an alternative that will still give you spectacular views of Mount Fitz Roy.

Laguna Capri

Difficulty: Moderate

Distance: 8 kilometres round trip 

Elevation gain: 430 metres

Time: 3-4 hours 

The hike to Laguna Capri is a popular and relatively moderate trek and it's on the way to Laguna de los Tres.

The round-trip trek to Laguna Capri is approximately 8 kilometres (4.9 miles), and it usually takes around 3 to 4 hours to complete.

To be honest, the day we hiked to Laguna de los Tres, we were only planning to go as far as Laguna Capri. We got there and had a snack next to the lagoon, but then we realized it was still early in the day, we weren't tired, and if the views were already this epic, it could only get better from here. 

But I digress, Laguna Capri is a beautiful hike in its own right and there's zero shame in making this your final destination. 

The trail winds through diverse landscapes, including forests and open plains, with the stunning backdrop of Cerro Fitz Roy in the horizon. While this hike is considered moderate, some uphill sections require a reasonable level of fitness.

Overall, Laguna Capri is a fantastic way to experience the stunning landscapes of Los Glaciares National Park without the intensity of some of the more challenging treks in the area. Plus, the serene beauty of the lake and the surrounding mountains make it a beautiful place to linger and enjoy the views.

Laguna Capri is a half-day hike, so I would suggest packing a picnic and enjoying a leisurely meal next to the lake. 

Cerro Torre

Difficulty: Moderate

Distance: 17.5 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 501 metres 

Time: 6-7 hours

The hike to Cerro Torre is another iconic trek in El Chaltén offering stunning views of the famous Cerro Torre.

This peak is the highest of a four-mountain chain that also includes Torre Egger, Punta Herron, and Cerro Standhardt.

The round trip to Cerro Torre is approximately 17.5 kilometres (10.8 miles). The duration of the hike varies but usually takes around 6 to 7 hours, depending on your pace and the trail conditions (some stretches can be muddy). It is considered a moderately challenging trek.

You start out hiking through a beautiful valley and you also get to see some waterfalls along the way. 

The majority of the elevation gain happens at the start of the trek, but then things flatten out around kilometre 3.5, which makes it easy to set a steady pace and cover a lot of ground. 

One of the things we enjoyed about this trail was the fact that we could see Torre Glacier in the horizon, which was motivating. Plus we got to hike through forests and along a river, so the scenery was constantly changing. 

The highlight of the Cerro Torre hike is reaching the viewpoint overlooking Laguna Torre, a glacial lake at the base of Cerro Torre. The lake is often dotted with icebergs, and the backdrop of the iconic mountain provides a stunning setting for photography.

The downside of our experience was that by the time we reached the shores of Laguna Torre, clouds had rolled in and they covered Cerro Torre, so we didn't get that iconic view. 

Once you reach Laguna Torre, you can continue a bit further to Mirador Maestri for even better views of the Torre Glacier. 

Loma del Pliegue Tumbado

Difficulty: Hard

Distance: 18.3 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 1,127 metres

Time: 7 hours

Loma del Pliegue Tumbado is a good trek for those seeking a slightly less crowded alternative to some of the more popular trails in El Chaltén - namely Laguna de los Tres and Laguna Torre! 

The trailhead starts at the Visitor Center, same as Mirador de Los Cóndores and Mirador de Las Águilas, except there is a marker indicating you go right. 

You'll hike through scattered forests, then reach a section known as Pampa de las Carretas which is flat, and you'll then continue your ascent until you're past the timberline.

The final push is the hardest and most demanding portion of the hike given the quick elevation gain. It also consists of switchbacks and loose rock.

However, the highlight of Loma del Pliegue Tumbado is reaching the summit and taking in the breathtaking vistas. The final destination is a viewpoint on a ridge that offers 360-degree panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, including Mount Fitz Roy, Cerro Torre, Lake Viedma, Cerro Huemul and the Río Túnel Valley.

Be warned that it can be very windy at the top! The big joke with this hike is, ""The only time you don’t go up is when you go down!""

Cerro Huemul Circuit

Difficulty: Very hard

Distance: 66.8 km

Elevation gain: 2,838 m

Time: 4 days

The Cerro Huemul Circuit is a challenging multi-day trek covering 66.8 kilometres on a loop trail where you'll be overnight camping along the way.

This is a technical trek best reserved for experienced hikers as it involves two river crossings (these can be done via pulley or barefoot) and part of the trail is across a glacier! You also need to carry all your own equipment, so if you're unsure, chat with the rangers at the Visitors Centre to see if this trail is for you. 

Day 1 connects El Chaltén with Laguna Toro Camp. Then on Day 2 you continue from Laguna Toro Camp to Paso del Viento Camp. Day 3 brings you from Paso del Viento Camp to Lago Viedma Camp. Finally, on Day 4, you go from Lago Viedma Camp to Bahía Túnel, and you can then either arrange transportation (or hike) back to El Chaltén.

As with many treks in Patagonia, the best time to undertake the Cerro Huemul Circuit is during the Austral summer (December to March). During this period, the weather is more favourable for trekking, with milder temperatures and longer daylight hours, though it can be very windy.

Before embarking on the Huemul Circuit, you must first obtain a permit from the park office Centro de Visitantes Guardaparque Ceferino Fonzo. This can be done in the days leading up to your trek, or the morning of your departure. In order to qualify for the permit, you'll have to demonstrate you have the required gear and also watch a short presentation so you know what to expect from the trek.

This is a good overview of what the Huemul Circuit entails from someone who has actually done the trek.

Easy Hikes in El Chalten

Mirador Rio de las Vueltas

Difficulty: Easy

Distance: 2 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 200 metres 

Time: 1 hour

Mirador de las Vueltas is a short hiking trail that provides views of the Las Vueltas River, which flows to the east of El Chalten.

The trailhead is on the north end of town at the end of Avenida San Martín and it's the same route you would take if you were hiking to Laguna Capri or Laguna de los Tres. 

It's a 30-minute walk to reach the lookout. The trek is mainly uphill, but it's a short walk with beautiful views. Once you reach the lookout, you have wooden benches where you can sit, rest your legs and soak in the landscapes. 

The trail provides impressive views of the Río de las Vueltas Valley, a winding river valley surrounded by rugged mountain terrain.

Mirador de los Cóndores

Difficulty: Easy-Moderate

Distance: 2.6 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 130 metres

Time: 1 hour

The hike to Mirador de los Cóndores is considered easy to moderate, making it suitable for most hikers, including families. 

This is a short 2.6-kilometre round trip hike, and though the uphill climb can be a bit steep in places, the reward is the panoramic view of the town of El Chalten. 

As its name suggests, Mirador de los Cóndores is an excellent place to spot Andean condors flying overhead. These magnificent birds have an impressive wingspan, and they are often seen soaring on the thermal currents in the area.

Aside from spotting condors, from the viewpoint, you can also enjoy panoramic views of El Chaltén, the De Las Vueltas River, and the surrounding peaks including Mount Fitz Roy. On clear days, the vistas are particularly breathtaking.

Because the viewpoint faces west, this is a nice spot to catch sunset over El Chaltén.

The trailhead begins near the entrance to El Chaltén and it's very well-marked, so finding your way will be straightforward.

Mirador de las Águilas

Difficulty: Easy-Moderate

Distance: 5.3 kilometres round trip

Elevation gain: 215 metres

Time: 2 hours

Mirador de las Águilas is another relatively easy yet rewarding trail, known for its breathtaking views and the opportunity to observe birds of prey, including eagles, which gives the viewpoint its name Eagles' Viewpoint.

This loop trail is 5.3 kilometres in length and it starts at the same trailhead as Mirador de Los Cóndores and it includes a stop at the same viewpoint. 

You then continue east until you reach another lookout point that offers views of the Patagonian steppe, the milky turquoise waters of Lago Viedma, the Viedma Glacier, and the Andes Mountains. 

Because this viewpoint faces east, this is a nice spot to catch sunrise.

Chorrillo del Salto

Difficulty: Easy

Distance: 6.6 kilometres round trip 

Elevation gain: 139 meters

Time: 1.5-2 hours

Chorrillo del Salto is a popular and relatively easy hike in El Chalten. It is 6.6 kilometres round trip on a mostly flat trail, and it can take between 1.5 to 2 hours to complete depending on your pace. 

The trail leads to the Chorrillo del Salto Waterfall, a picturesque and serene spot surrounded by lush forest. The waterfall itself is about 20 meters (65 feet) high and is a beautiful sight, especially after the rainy season when the water flow is at its peak.

The one thing we didn't like about this trail is that most of the hike is on a dirt road, Provincial Route 23, so it doesn't have the same appeal as a forest hike. 

This is a suitable trail for hikers of all levels, including families with children.

There's a parking lot near the waterfall, so if you cannot hike, you can drive there and it's then a short walk to visit the waterfall.

Tips for trekking in El Chalten

Stop by the Visitors Centre. The office is located at the entrance of town and it's a good place to get information on various day hikes and current weather updates. This is also where you register for overnight treks. 

Start the day early if you want to witness sunrise and bring a torchlight so you're not tripping on the trail.

Wear a sturdy pair of hiking boots. While you can get away with sneakers for easy hikes, you'll want a good pair of hiking boots if you're attempting some of the more challenging trails. Also, make sure you've broken in your boots before you arrive in Patagonia!

Pack a pair of trekking poles. These will come in handy for trails with a high elevation gain. 

Dress in layers. Because the weather conditions in Patagonia are constantly changing, it's good to be prepared for all climates. I recommend a quick-drying base layer, a fleece, a weatherproof jacket and hiking pants. Bring a hat to protect yourself from the sun. Depending on the time of year you're visiting you may need a hat, scarf, and gloves.

Bring sufficient water and snacks. Many guesthouses around town offer a packed lunch service you can order the night before. Alternatively, there are small stores around town where you can load up on energy bars, nuts and fruit. 

Wear sunscreen. Even if the weather feels mild, you can still get a sunburn.

Check the weather forecast before embarking on a hike. Intense winds can make certain hikes near impossible to complete. When in doubt, check at the Visitors Centre.

Register for overnight treks. This is mandatory so no hikers are unaccounted for. Share your proposed route and expected date of return at the Visitors Centre. 

Other Things to Do in El Chalten (Not Trekking!)

Now let's move on to some fun things to do in El Chalten that don't involve any hiking! Your legs will probably need a break at some point during your visit, so here are other activities to consider. 

River Rafting Río de las Vueltas

If you're looking for an outdoor adventure that's not hiking, consider kayaking the Río de las Vueltas on a guided tour. 

Río de las Vueltas is a river of glacial origin that is born in Lago del Desierto and flows into Lake Viedma. 

The first 6 kilometres of the river are calm, so it's a good opportunity to enjoy the surrounding scenery (hello Mount Fitz Roy!) and ease into the experience. 

The second part goes through a canyon area. The initial rapid is called Portage (no, you are not getting out of the water and portaging your raft!) followed by a succession of class III to III+ rapids for the next 10 kilometres. Get ready for the adrenaline to start pumping!

Yes, these waters are glacially cold, as you'd expect, but you'll be geared up with a neoprene suit, microfleece, jacket, life jacket, helmet, neoprene boots and mittens. 

Once the descent is finished, a van will be waiting to take you back to the base where you will change and enjoy a snack and a drink to recover your energy.

You can book your river rafting adventure on Río de las Vueltas here.

Kayaking Río de las Vueltas

If you want to hit the water, but rafting sounds a little to extreme, consider kayaking instead. 

For this trip, you'll travel with your guide along Provincial Route 41 until you reach Lago del Desierto or Lake of the Desert. 

Kayaking in these waters means getting decked out in all the necessary gear; in this case a neoprene suit, microfleece, jacket, helmet, life jacket, boots, mittens and paddles. 

The kayaking adventure begins north of El Chaltén in a section of the river that's shallow. From this point, you'll travel 12 kilometres downstream, which will take between 1.5 and 2 hours depending on the river flow and wind conditions. 

Along the way, you'll get to enjoy a unique perspective of Mount Fitz Roy, the Rio de las Vueltas Valley and the Andean forest.

The destination of this kayaking tour is Estancia Bonanza, where you'll have a delicious lunch at the ranch before returning to El Chaltén.

You can book your kayaking trip to Estancia Bonanza here.

Horseback Riding at Estancia Bonanza

Another activity you can enjoy in El Chaltén is horseback riding at Estancia Bonanza. 

This estancia is located 12 kilometres north of El Chaltén and it sits at the foot of Cordón del Bosque, a mountain range that's characterized by its forests, glaciers, rivers and lagoons. 

This horseback riding tour is 2 hours long and it takes you to the most remote corners of the ranch where you can enjoy unspoilt scenery in a corner of Patagonia that not many get to see. 

Two daily horseback riding excursions are available: one in the morning with lunch, and the other in the afternoon with dinner. Hours are adjusted depending on the time of year. 

So if you didn't get your fill of estancia life in El Calafate, you have the opportunity to visit another estancia here in El Chaltén!

You can book your horseback riding excursion at Estancia Bonanza here.

Rockclimbing in El Chaltén

El Chaltén is a popular destination for rock climbing. The Paredón is a giant wall to the east of town overlooking the Las Vueltas River, where you can often see rock climbers.

If you're looking to go with a guide, Mountaineering Patagonia are your people. They offer a single pitch rock climbing outing where you'll tackle routes ranging from grade IV to VI. You'll learn the basic knots, how to belay and rappel. This activity takes around 4 hours and is geared at those in beginner and intermediate levels. 

They also offer a multi-pitch rock climbing full-day outing. The morning is spent on single-pitch routes ranging from grade IV to VI, and in the afternoon you move on to the multi-pitch climb (4-5 pitches) graded IV to V+. This activity takes between 6-8 hours.

Where to Eat in El Chaltén

Senderos

This restaurant is part of Hostería Senderos, a boutique guesthouse in the south end of town, and they serve up some delicious meals. We ate here on two occasions. 

The first night, we tried their blue cheese risotto with walnuts and sundried tomatoes, as well as a lentil stew. This was our celebratory dinner after trekking to Laguna de los Tres. 

We enjoyed the meal so much that we went back another time and had their ñoqui with wild mushrooms and stuffed ravioli in tomato sauce. 

For dessert, we tried the apple pancake with calafate berry ice cream and a chocolate mousse. Both were divine!

La Zorra Taproom

This is another spot in town that we revisited because there's nothing better than a juicy hamburger and a mountain of loaded fries after a long day of trekking! 

La Zorra Taproom is a brewpub and they specialize in hamburgers, pizzas, loaded fries and salads. 

They also craft beer on tap with fun names like Scotch Ale, Passion Summer and Choco Milk.

They're located in the north end of town, so it's very convenient if you've just finished hiking one of the trails in that area. 

Cúrcuma

This is a vegan restaurant in El Chaltén and we visited out of curiosity. Though we are not vegan, we were starting to crave some healthier veggie options after many of months pizza, pasta and parrilla in Argentina. 

We were pleasantly surprised by their quinoa bowl loaded with grilled veggies, and we also had a type of barley bowl with more veggies and alfalfa. 

Their current menu features items like pumpkin risotto, stuffed eggplant, zucchini pasta, and various wraps and salads. Plus loads of smoothies and fresh-squeezed juices. 

La Waffleria

This spot specializes in waffles with savoury and sweet toppings. If you're craving something savoury, you can get waffles with ham and cheese, with bacon and eggs, or with blue cheese and walnuts. 

And if you're craving something sweet, like we were, you have waffles with dulce de leche, with ice cream, or with whipped cream and berries. We got one with scoops of calafate berry ice cream. 

Another cool thing about this restaurant is that they have card games available, so that makes it a nice place to linger. 

Patagonicus

This restaurant is located in the south end of town and specializes in pizzas, soups and salads. The menu is simple but the food is filling. 

They have 15 different pizzas on the menu - Napolitana, Calabresa and Roquefort, to name a few. They even a vegan pizza option. 

This is a convenient location if you're planning to tackle some of the hikes near the Visitors Centre. 

Where to Stay in El Chaltén

Here are three hotels in El Chaltén, representing luxury, mid-range, and budget-friendly categories, each with excellent reviews. 

Hostería Vertical Lodge

This is where we stayed and it's a mid-range option! This guesthouse is located near the entrance of town, so on the south side overlooking the Las Vueltas River and the Paredón, which is the rock climbing wall.

It puts you close to the trailheads for Mirador de los Cóndores, Mirador de las Aguilas, and Loma Del Pliegue Tumbado.

The rooms are very spacious – great for sprawling all our hiking gear! And the bathroom is big with a piping hot shower, which was much appreciated at the end of a long day on the trails. 

Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of sweet and savoury options. They also offer a packed lunch service, which we made use of for our two big days of hiking.

Book your stay at Hostería Vertical Lodge. 

Los Cerros Boutique Hotel & Spa

Los Cerros Boutique Hotel & Spa is a 4-star boutique hotel located in the centre of El Chaltén. Because it sits on a small hill, it offers great views of the town below and the surrounding mountains. 

The hotel has a spa with a hot tub and sauna, plus you can book hot stones massages - ideal for those who want a bit of pampering in between all the hiking. 

Their on-site restaurant serves a combination of Patagonian and international dishes.

Book your stay at Los Cerros Boutique Hotel & Spa.

Hostel Rancho Grande

Hostel Rancho Grande is a ranch-style hostel conveniently located in the north end of town near some of the most popular trailheads like Laguna Capri and Laguna de los Tres. 

The hostel provides mixed dormitories with shared bathrooms and private rooms with en suite bathrooms. Plus, it has a communal kitchen and a social atmosphere. 

It's a budget-friendly option in El Chaltén, popular among backpackers and budget travellers. 

Book your stay at Hostel Rancho Grande.

You can also find luxury glamping domes on the outskirts of town, so that might be one way to cap off your time in El Chaltén! Chalten Camp and Patagonia Eco Domes are two popular choices with travellers.

When is the Best time to visit El Chaltén?

Spring (September to November)

Spring brings milder temperatures, and the landscape begins to awaken with blooming flowers. It's a quieter time with fewer tourists. The hiking trails start to become accessible, although some higher-altitude trails may still have snow.

Summer (December to February)

This is the high tourist season with the warmest temperatures. Daylight hours are long, and evenings are pleasant. This is when hiking trails are fully accessible and it's an excellent time for trekking and outdoor activities. 

Fall (March to May)

Fall sees cooler temperatures, and the colours of autumn foliage add a unique charm to the landscape. The crowds diminish compared to the summer season, although it's a popular time of year for photographers to visit El Chalten. Hiking is still viable, although some trails might close later in the season due to snow.

Winter (June to August)

Winter is the coldest season, with snow covering the landscapes. Many facilities and accommodations close during this period. Winter offers a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It's a good time for photographers and those seeking a quieter experience. However, access to some hiking trails will be limited due to snow and ice. If you're interested in specific hikes, check their accessibility during your chosen time at the Visitors Centre.

Ultimately, the best time to visit El Chaltén depends on your interests and the type of experience you seek. If you're a trekking enthusiast, the austral summer months (December to February) offer the most favourable conditions. If you prefer a quieter atmosphere and don't mind some limitations on certain trails, the shoulder seasons of spring and fall can provide a wonderful experience.

Regardless of the season, be prepared for rapid weather changes. Patagonian weather is notoriously unpredictable, and conditions can shift quickly.

The town of Esquel is situated in the northwestern end of the Province of Chubut, right at the foot of the Andes Mountain Range, and for a small mountain town, it has a lot to offer! 

If you're an active traveller who enjoys nature and the outdoors, you'll like the hiking opportunities the town has to offer.

Plus, Esquel's strategic location makes it a great base for taking day trips to nearby places like Los Alerces National Park, the neighbouring Welsh community of Trevelin, the strange rock formations at Piedra Parada, and much more. In short, Esquel needs to be on your list of places to visit in Patagonia.

You could easily spend a week here and have a different activity for each day of the week, so in this article, we're going to share some of the best things to do in Esquel, plus some fun day trips to go on!

Things to do in Esquel, Argentina

Wondering what to do in Esquel? We've got you covered with this list of some of the top attractions in town.

Old Patagonian Express

One of the main draws to Esquel is the opportunity to travel aboard the Old Patagonian Express. In fact, that's what first piqued our interes in this town!

Known as La Trochita in Spanish, this historic narrow-gauge train dates back to 1935, and it’s one of the most iconic train journeys you can go on in all of Argentina.

It was made famous by Paul Theroux’s 1979 novel The Old Patagonian Express, in which he recounts his travels from his hometown in Massachusetts all the way down to Argentina by train.

Originally, the Old Patagonian Express stretched out across 402 kilometres, however, today only three shorter segments of the route can be travelled by tourists. The most popular of those segments is the one that runs from Esquel to Nahuel Pan.

The train station is located right in town, so you can just walk over and buy your tickets in person.

It’s a one-hour journey to Nahuel Pan, you then get 45 minutes to visit the Museum of Patagonian Culture and browse the artisanal market, before travelling another hour back to Esquel.

This is a half-day activity and it really is a must-do if you are planning to visit Esquel.

Laguna La Zeta

One of the main attractions in Esquel is Laguna La Zeta, a natural urban reserve on the outskirts of town. The lagoon gets its name from the Z-shaped trail that zig-zags its way up the mountain.

Laguna La Zeta can be reached by car (10 minutes) or on foot (1 hour). Just be aware that it’s a steep gravel road that hikers share with vehicles, so be mindful and stay to the side. Towards the end of the hike, the trail deviates into the forest for a bit of peace and serenity.

We hiked to the lagoon, but in retrospect, it would have been better to take a taxi to the lagoon and then do this trail that loops around the lagoon.

Once you reach Laguna La Zeta, you’ll notice there are kayak and canoe rentals, as well as horseback riding excursions. You can also enjoy a swim at the beach or stop to enjoy the view from the pavilion. It's even better if you pack a picnic!

Cerro La Cruz

As you can probably tell, hiking is one of the main things to do in Esquel, and another trek to add to the list is Cerro La Cruz or Mount of the Cross.

This trail takes about 1.5 hours each way, is medium-level difficulty, and reaches a maximum altitude of 1,050 metres.

This is a steep hike, but there are lookouts along the way, so you can enjoy some panoramic views of Esquel as you work your way to the top.

There are two main access points to hike Cerro de la Cruz. You can go via Barrio Baden on the east end of town or Barrio Ceferino on the west end.

Bike to Laguna Willmanco

If you're looking to stay active, another fun thing to do in Esquel is to rent a bike and cycle out to Laguna Willmanco. We were fortunate enough that our accommodations offered free bikes, so we hit the road. 

It was a steep ride out of town along the same road that leads up to the ski resort. It's an 8-kilometre journey roundtrip. There were sections where we had to get off our bikes and push uphill, but it was well worth the effort. 

Once we reached the white gate, we turned down a dirt road and rode towards the lagoon. The water was crystal clear, there were cows roaming free, and the mountain backdrop looked epic. 

We loved it even on a grey, overcast day. I can only imagine what it would look like when the sun's out!

Horse trek at Estancia Huemules

One of my favourite memories from Esquel is the day we went horse trekking at Estancia Huemules. This estancia is set in a nature reserve 23 kilometres from the city of Esquel and it's a slice of paradise! 

We just so happened to visit during peak autumn foliage and riding through the forest was a dream. We rode under a canopy of gold, and when we reached a clearing, we were able to see the mountain draped in shades of burgundy, pumpkin and ochre. 

This, in my opinion, is one of the more epic things to do in Esquel! We loved our day out at Huemules Estancia de Montaña. Next time, we need to actually stay the night!

Day trips from Esquel

Now that we've covered what there is to see and do in Esquel, let's move on to the day trips. And there are a lot to choose from!

Esquel is the gateway to numerous attractions in the Province of Chubut and the surrounding landscapes are pretty epic.

Los Alerces National Park

First up, we have a day trip to Los Alerces National Park. This park is set in the Andes Mountains of northern Patagonia and its western boundary coincides with the Chilean border.

The park consists of Valdivian forest and is home to hanging glaciers, snowcapped mountains, alpine meadows, and lakes and rivers that shift from turquoise to emerald.

Some of the park highlights include trekking to the Torrecillas Glacier, kayaking on the Río Arrayanes, cruising the waters of Lake Menéndez, and meeting a grandfather Alerce tree that is over 2,600 years old!

We had an epic day there and we only explored a tiny fraction of the park. There is a lot to visit in Los Alerces National Park, so I would recommend spending the whole day there.

This full-day tour covers some of the main points of interest in the park like the Arrayanes River, Irigoyen Waterfall and Puerto Chucao.

Piedra Parada

A popular day trip from Esquel is to Piedra Parada, which literally translates to ‘standing rock’.

This is a protected natural area made up of 132 hectares, and it earns its name from the giant rock that rises 240 metres in the middle of the Patagonian steppe.

Aside from the standing rock, there is a trail that leads into Vulture’s Canyon, where you can see ancient cave paintings.

We had no idea this place existed prior to visiting Esquel. We ended up booking this tour on a whim because it's what was available last minute, and we were not disappointed. You can imagine our faces, when we reached this otherworldly landscape!

If you visit Piedra Parada as part of an organized tour, you’ll have a guide to share the history of the place, you’ll enjoy a picnic by the river’s edge, and do some hiking (it’s relatively flat, so nothing too strenuous).

This area is also considered a rock climbing mecca, so if you’re into the sport, you can arrange a day trip to Piedra Parada that involves some rock climbing.

Trevelin

If you want to dive into Welsh culture in Patagonia, Trevelin is another day trip you can consider from Esquel. It’s only a 30-minute drive, and it can be done by local bus or taxi.

This town was founded by Welsh immigrants, and its name means ‘mill town’ in Welsh, named after the first flour mill, which was established in 1891.

Trevelin sits on the banks of the Percy River, and it has a very relaxed feel with mountain views to the west.

Some of the travel highlights in Trevelin include visiting the tulip farm (in the springtime), enjoying a Welsh afternoon tea, going to the Andes Mill Museum, visiting local wineries, and touring the Nant Fach Mill, where you can learn more about the history of Welsh immigration to Patagonia.

Cholila

Another Esquel day trip to consider is to the town of Cholila.

This town was made famous by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two American train and bank robbers who ended up hiding out in Patagonia.

They bought a ranch in Cholila - which is about as out of the way as you can get! - and changed their names in hopes of starting a new life.

Long story short, they were eventually tracked down, but their ranch in Cholila still stands.

La Hoya Ski Hill

If you’re travelling to Patagonia in the wintertime and you want to enjoy a bit of skiing and snowboarding, you can do so near Esquel.

The main ski centre there is La Hoya, which is a 30-minute drive north of town.

You can rent gear, book passes, or sign up for ski and snowboarding lessons all on their website.

Where to stay in Esquel

Hotel Sol del Sur - This centrally located hotel offers panoramic mountain views and a continental breakfast.

Departamentos Ailen - For those who prefer self-catering accommodations, this apartment in a quiet residential neighbourhood does the trick. (It's where we stayed!)

El Coiron Aparts - You can book at their main guesthouse or the Scandinavian-inspired cabins on the outskirts of town which offer an ideal setting for those looking for a quiet escape.

Where to eat in Esquel

Like almost anywhere else in Argentina, you're never too far from pizza and pasta. These are some of the places we ate at in Esquel:

Don Chiquino

For pastas, the most popular option in town is Don Chiquino. You choose your sauce and pasta to customize the dish just how you like it.

This is our favourite restaurant in Esquel and we've eaten there many times over the years, both at their old location and their new more-centrally located location.

I'm a big fan of their sorrentinos with walnuts, ricotta and mushrooms. The dish is pure perfection!

For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the Andean mousse featuring chocolate mousse, whipped cream, dulce de leche, chocolate shavings and walnuts.

You’ll need a nap after that!

Maria Castaña

If you’re looking to treat yourself to a big breakfast or indulge your sweet tooth for afternoon tea, then you need to visit Maria Castaña.

They know how to do cakes, pies and tarts, and it’s honestly kind of hard deciding what to order because everything looks so good! You can treat yourself to a specialty coffee and something sweet.

This is another spot we have visited many times both for breakfast and merienda, the Argentine equivalent of afternoon tea. 

Fitzroya Pizza

If you’re craving pizza, head straight to Fitzroya. They have the classics, but they also get really inventive with some of their toppings. Plus, they let you order half and half if you can’t decide on one thing.

We ate there a few times and even tried their ‘jamón a caballo’ pizza, which featured bacon and fried eggs. We haven’t found a pizza like that since!

Alto Pollo

Food by the weight is a popular lunchtime option in Argentina. At Alto Pollo, you can choose what you feel like eating and exactly how much.

It’s a serve-yourself setting, so grab a container, load it up, weigh it and pay. They have a nice variety of meats, pastas, beans and salads.

This is a nice option if you’re in between activities and you don’t have time for a long sit-down meal at a restaurant.

How to get to Esquel

If you're arriving by air, you can fly into the Esquel Airport (EQS). Flights are operated by the national airline Aerolineas Argentina a few days a week and they all go through Buenos Aires.

Another way to get to Esquel is by bus. There are multiple connections across Patagonia, including plenty of overnight buses to some further away destinations. You have all the major regional bus operators like Mar y Valle, Don Otto, Via Bariloche, Transporte Jacobsen, and Etap. So wherever you're coming from, there's a bus to Esquel!

If you prefer to have a bit more control over your schedule, then you can rent a car to get around Esquel and the surrounding area. You can book one at the Esquel Airport or one of the numerous car rental agencies across town.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,df39861324a429cb5673bf18c905645bc916eb28

San Antonio de Areco is known as the cradle of gaucho culture and tradition and the best part is that it's a super accessible destination from Buenos Aires. 

This is the place to visit if you want to spend the day at an estancia, learn about gaucho culture, and visit museums and galleries that document rural country life in Argentina. 

The town of San Antonio de Areco is set in the pampas, the vast flat plains that are home to endless cattle ranches and agricultural lands.

Visiting the town is like taking a step back in time; colonial buildings line the plazas and green boulevards, you can see locals riding their horses through town, and every few blocks you'll come across a traditional bar known as a pulpería. 

Whether you're visiting on one of your day trips from Buenos Aires or spending the night, in this San Antonio de Areco travel guide we'll share everything you need to know to plan your perfect trip!

Short on time? You can visit San Antonio de Areco on a guided day tour from Buenos Aires, which includes a day at a local estancia plus transportation to and from the city.

How to Get to San Antonio de Areco

First things first, how do you get to Antonio de Areco? You have three options, so let's cover them all from easiest to hardest. 

Book a tour

The easiest way to visit San Antonio de Areco is to join a guided tour that includes transportation to and from Buenos Aires. These tours offer hotel pick-up and drop-off, so you don't have to worry about navigating public transportation, especially if you aren't confident in your Spanish skills.

Most day tours to San Antonio de Areco combine a visit to the town with a day at an estancia. Here are a few different ones to consider:

Gaucho Day at Estancia + Town - You will briefly visit Museo Draghi, Parroquia San Antonio de Padua, and Boliche de Bessonart Bar in the town of San Antonio de Areco. You will then continue to the estancia for horseback riding or carriage riding, a traditional Argentine BBQ, live folklore music and dance, and a horse-whispering demonstration by a gaucho.

Gaucho Day at Estancia + Town (Private Tour) - This private tour also begins with a stop in the town where you'll visit Parroquia San Antonio de Padua, Boliche de Bessonart Bar, Town Hall, Museo Draghi, The Copper Pot Chocolate Shop, and the Gaucho Museum. This private tour covers a few more landmarks in town than the group tour. You then continue to the estancia for a horseback ride or carriage ride, a traditional Argentine BBQ, live folklore music and dance, and a horse-whispering demonstration by a gaucho.

Take the bus

Your next option is to take the bus, which is what we did. We travelled from Retiro, the main bus terminal in Buenos Aires, to San Antonio de Areco.

The bus company Chevallier offers the most frequency, but even so, there are only a handful of buses per day, so you'll want to plan your schedule in advance. You can check out BusBud for updated departures. I would also recommend buying your return ticket in advance to guarantee you have a way back into the city!

It's important to know that San Antonio de Areco does NOT have a bus terminal! You will be dropped off at a gas station on the side of the highway. From there, you'll need to take a taxi or you're looking at a 20-minute walk into town (there is an overpass to get across the highway). 

Getting a taxi proved to be a little tricky. There were no taxis waiting there, so we had to ask someone to call us a taxi at the kiosk by the bus stop and when that didn't work, we tried at the gas station. Because this is a small town, there aren't that many taxi drivers, and it took a few attempts to find a driver who was available. You'll need some Spanish if you run into this problem, but in the worst-case scenario, you walk.

Rent a car

Your next option is to rent a car either in Buenos Aires or Ezeiza and drive yourself to San Antonio de Areco. 

Would I recommend this to non-experienced travellers who haven't driven in major cities? No way! Driving in Buenos Aires is not for the faint-hearted, and you may be shocked by the way drivers swerve across lanes.

However, most locals do drive to San Antonio de Areco and we even met an Italian couple who did the same - they said it was easier than driving in Italy, so take that with a grain of salt!

Things to do in San Antonio de Areco, Argentina 

There are plenty of things to do in San Antonio de Areco to keep you occupied for an action-packed day or even for a couple of days! Most of the activities in and around town revolve around the gaucho culture, silversmithing and estancias. 

Spend the day at an estancia

I would say the main draw to San Antonio de Areco is to come and experience the rich gaucho culture, and the best way to do so is by spending the day at an estancia. 

There is no shortage of estancias in San Antonio de Areco, but the most famous of them all is El Ombú de Areco. This estancia dates back to 1880, and it has belonged to the same family since 1934. They offer a countryside gaucho day program, which is what we booked.

During our visit to the estancia, which was a full-day activity, we were welcomed with empanadas and a beverage that we enjoyed out in the garden. We then had the opportunity to go on a guided horseback ride of the estancia or a carriage ride - we opted for the latter since it's something we hadn't done before!

Next, we enjoyed a traditional Argentine asado or BBQ out on the veranda of the historic home. The food was abundant with multiple salads and side dishes and seemingly never-ending meat platters featuring sausage, beef, pork and chicken. This was followed by dessert and coffee.

As lunch was beginning to wind down, we got to enjoy folklore music, and later all the guests were invited to learn a traditional dance. I was quite impressed that not one single guest declined! I'm pretty sure it's because everyone was feeling pretty brave after downing a full bottle of Malbec wine. It was a really fun experience.

Then, it was time for the doma india, which can best be translated as 'horse-whispering'. Gauchos have a unique bond with their horses and their approach to taming them is a gentle one built on trust. We got to see a demonstration where the gaucho led his horse into a variety of positions - down on his side, on his back, legs in the air - all demonstrating their close bond.

We then had free time to enjoy the estancia. During the summer months, you can pack your bathing suit and towel and enjoy the swimming pool. The rest of the year you can enjoy the soccer field, volleyball court, pool tables, ping pong and more. Honestly, after so much food, we were just happy to rest on the lounge chairs and befriend the estancia dogs. That was about all we could handle!

Finally, it was merienda time, which would be the equivalent of an afternoon tea. We got to enjoy a beverage and a slice of cake, which was on the lighter side for a merienda, but I don't think we could have possibly eaten any more!

So that gives you an idea of what to expect from an estancia day in San Antonio de Areco - in this case, at El Ombú de Areco.

Visit the silversmith workshops

San Antonio de Areco is well-known for its many silversmith workshops and as such, it's a great destination to buy Argentine silver. You'll see many Taller de Platería signs, which in Spanish translate to 'silversmith workshop'.

We visited the Draghi Silversmith Workshop and the Draghi Museum located on the north end of Plaza Ruiz de Arellano. The Draghi name is very respected in San Antonio de Areco and is synonymous with the silversmithing tradition.

The workshop was founded by Juan Jose Draghi, one of Argentina's most notable silver craftsmen, who during the 1960s took the dying gaucho silversmithing tradition and put it back on the map. 

The Draghi Museum boasts a small, private collection that showcases the evolution of silversmithing in Argentina from the 19th century up until the present. They have beautiful displays of silver mates (used to drink Argentina's famous bitter, green tea beverage), silver knives, and all sorts of decorative silver items worn by gauchos and horses.

The tradition has since been continued by Juan Jose Draghi's two sons: Mariano Draghi works out of the workshop at Lavalle 387 while his brother Patricio Draghi works one block north out of the workshop on Arellano 45.

Enjoy a walking tour of Areco's main sights

We found San Antonio de Areco to be a super walkable town. 

Many of the main attractions are clustered around Plaza Ruiz de Arellano, a beautiful tree-lined square named after the town's founder. On weekends, you can shop at the local fair, which features all sorts of handmade crafts and artisanal goods.

On the south side of the plaza, you'll find the town church Parroquia San Antonio de Padua, and you have the Old Town Hall on the northwest corner. 

Just a couple of blocks north of the central square, you can enjoy a riverside walk along the Areco River before crossing over to the other side of town via Puente Viejo or the Old Bridge. Just beware that if you visit during the summer months, the mosquitoes can be fierce by the water, so wear bug spray or cover up!

Try the artisanal chocolate

La Olla de Cobre translates to 'The Copper Pot' and it's the most famous artisanal chocolate shop in San Antonio de Areco. Seriously, if you have a bit of a sweet tooth, you need to swing through here!

What makes this chocolate shop special is that it combines hand-selected ingredients with a willingness to experiment with a combination of flavours, aromas and textures.

We visited after a busy morning of museum-hopping and wandering the town's cobbled streets. As soon as we arrived, we were invited to sample some of their chocolate.

We decided to get a sampler box with a whole bunch of different flavours. You can get chocolate with dulce de leche, coconut, cereal, peanuts, almonds, figs, plums, rum-soaked grapes, cinnamon and so much more. 

Plus, they also have delicious alfajores filled with dulce de leche and bathed in either chocolate or meringue. We just had to get one of each!

I was under the impression that this place was like a cafe where you can sit down and enjoy your chocolate or alfajores, maybe with a cup of coffee, but it's strictly a shop and quite a small one at that, so you place your order and go.

Museums in San Antonio de Areco

Before you begin your quest to visit the many museums of San Antonio de Areco, I would recommend making sure they are actually open as some of these are on the outskirts of town. 

On the southeast end of Plaza Ruiz de Arellano, you're going to find a small booth offering tourist information. You can chat with the person there to see if any of the museums are temporarily closed, plus you can get an updated schedule for each museum since opening hours vary depending on the time of year.

Museo Gauchesco Ricardo Güiraldes - This museum is located on the other side of the Areco River and can be reached by crossing the Old Bridge or Puente Viejo. It is set inside Parque Criollo, which is a National Historic Monument. The museum is named after Argentine novelist and poet Ricardo Güiraldes best known for his 1926 gaucho novel Don Segundo Sombra. The focus is rural country life in the Argentine Pampas as well as gaucho culture. View the website here.

Usina Vieja Museo Centro Cultural - This museum is set in a former power plant that supplied electricity to part of the town in its early days. The space is divided into three different galleries plus an outdoor courtyard with wooden sculptures.

Museo Las Lilas De Areco - This museum features paintings and sculptures depicting scenes of gaucho life and rural Argentina. There are sets where you can pose for photos and there's a beautiful central courtyard. View the website here.

Museo Draghi - We already mentioned this museum when we talked about the silversmiths in town. This museum is located inside the Draghi workshop and it has a small but impressive private collection featuring all things silver.

La Recova De Gasparini - This art museum features the paintings of Miguel Ángel Gasparini. He is a local painter and is often there to welcome visitors. The focus of his works is gaucho culture.

Museo Evocativo Osvaldo Gasparini - This is a small museum showcasing the works of Osvaldo Gasparini across different mediums. His son offers guided visits.

Where to Eat in San Antonio de Areco

San Antonio de Areco has a really fun mix of restaurants, cafes and pulperías (old bars). Here are a few of the highlights.

El Mitre

El Mitre is a historic bar located on the southwest corner of Plaza Ruiz de Arellano. This was the first restaurant we visited in San Antonio de Areco, mainly because it's such a convenient location right across from the main square. 

I had been craving steak so I got the bife de chorizo or strip steak. This was served with a side salad and an order of crispy fried potato slices.

Meanwhile, Sam ordered the milanesa a la napolitana, which is like a veal schnitzel topped with tomato sauce, ham, cheese and oregano. This is a classic dish and it came with a side of French fries. 

Address: Alsina 151

Almacén de Ramos Generales

Another restaurant we enjoyed was the Almacén de Ramos Generales which features classic regional dishes.

I got their corn pie casserole; picture a shepherd's pie where the mashed potato is swapped out for mashed corn. Both the corn and the ground beef were slightly sweet, which I really enjoyed. 

Sam ordered the pork cutlets topped with caramelized onions and served with apple puree, so it was another sweet dish!

Address: Zapiola 143

El Tokio

For a hearty homemade lunch, we visited El Tokio; don't let the name fool you, this is not a Japanese restaurant!

I ordered their grilled chicken with a side of pumpkin puree - a simple yet sweet and filling meal. Meanwhile, Sam got the homemade potato ñoqui with the bolognese sauce - these were plump and simply divine. 

El Tokio is also very well known for its ice cream. They have a mouthwatering list of flavours featuring lots of Argentine classics like dulce de leche, flan, and kumquat in whiskey.

Address: Arellano 152

Balthazar Areco

This pulpería feels like a living museum; the walls are adorned with all sorts of collectibles and antiques. 

We had dinner here one night and ordered the picada to share. This is basically a snacking board featuring an assortment of cheeses, deli meats, nuts, olives, raisins and bread. It's a nice light option if you've been indulging in some heavier meals during your visit.

The menu here is honestly quite limited and simple, so it's more of a place for drinks and snacks. Think sandwiches, empanadas, and a dish of the day. You come here more for the ambience than the food.

Where to Stay in San Antonio de Areco

We have an entire guide dedicated to the best places to stay in San Antonio de Areco, featuring a mix of estancias and boutique hotels. However, here's a condensed list with some varied options.

Estancia La Cinacina - This is one of the few estancias that's within walking distance of the old town - just 6 blocks to the central plaza to be precise! This is where we stayed. We thoroughly enjoyed the sprawling grounds and the rustic and colonial charm of the place, plus breakfast was abundant. We visited a bit later in the season, but they do have a swimming pool for those visiting in the summertime.

Hotel Draghi - This is a charming boutique hotel run by the Draghi family who are known for their silversmithing in town. The property features antique furnishings, a charming garden with a water fountain, and a central location right in the heart of the historic town centre. 

La Escondida - This bed and breakfast is centrally located in the old town. It features simple rooms with a charming courtyard and it's one of the top-rated properties in its price range.

Many Buenos Aires estancias are clustered in and around San Antonio de Areco, so this is a great town to visit if you're after that experience. 

You can also find some unusual accommodations like converted train cars, so there are glamping options to consider!

Tips for visiting San Antonio de Areco

There are a few things to consider when planning a visit to San Antonio de Areco which will impact your experience, so here we go:

Day trip or stay overnight?

San Antonio de Areco is a very versatile destination; you can plan an action-packed day trip where you hit up the main attractions, or you can opt for a quieter visit where you enjoy the slow-paced rhythm of this gaucho town.

We opted for the latter and I think this is a great place to unwind after experiencing the frantic energy of Buenos Aires, however, if you're short on time, there's nothing wrong with visiting for the day.

Weekends are livelier

Since we spent several days in San Antonio de Areco, we got to see it buzzing with visitors over the weekend, which is also when all the restaurants, cafes and attractions were open. 

By contrast, weekdays offered fewer sightseeing opportunities as businesses operate on a more reduced schedule. 

There were no crowds on weekdays, so we got to experience a more local vibe, but food options were also limited to a handful of restaurants.

Visit an estancia for the full experience

Part of the draw to San Antonio de Areco is the destination's rich gaucho tradition and the best way to experience this is by spending the day at one of the many estancias. 

The program varies from one estancia to the next, but the one we visited - Estancia El Ombú de Areco - offered visitors the chance to ride horses, feast on a traditional Argentine barbecue, enjoy traditional folklore music and dance, and witness a horse-whispering demonstration with a gaucho.

Plan your transportation

As I mentioned earlier, transportation to San Antonio de Areco needs to be planned in advance. 

Daily buses operate on a limited schedule and can sell out, so you'll want to book your seat there and back in advance. 

Alternatively, consider a day tour that includes transportation to and from Buenos Aires, or if you're spending the night, see if your hotel can arrange a private transfer.

Attend Fiesta de la Tradición

If your travels are bringing you to Buenos Aires in November, then you may want to attend Fiesta de la Tradición. 

This is an action-packed 3-day event where you can experience gaucho traditions. There is a gaucho parade on horseback, live folklore music, traditional dancing, local food and so much more. 

If you plan to attend this festival, book your accommodations in advance as it's a big event that draws visitors from far and wide. 

Beware of the mosquitoes

If you are visiting San Antonio de Areco during the summer months, know that it can get quite hot and humid. 

The temperatures tend to bring out the mosquitoes in swarms (some years are worse than others!) and it can be especially bothersome along the river. If this coincides with your visit, pack some bug spray because you'll need it.

This is one of the most popular Ushuaia trips visitors can take from the southernmost city on Earth.

Some people choose to visit Tolhuin for a half day, others for a full day, but if you really want to experience the magic of this tranquil lakeside town, you should give yourself at least 2-3 days.

Maybe you’ve had a few busy days sightseeing around Ushuaia, maybe you’re fresh off an Antarctica cruise, or maybe you’re just looking for a quiet destination to end your Patagonia trip.

Reaching Ushuaia takes some effort, so you may as well linger a while!

Whatever is that brings you here, we have some ideas of things to do in Tolhuin, as well as recommendations for where to stay and where to eat.

The following is our travel guide to Tolhuin, Argentina.

The lakeside town of Tolhuin in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina

How to get to Tolhuin

The distance between Ushuaia and Tolhuin is 103 kilometres or 1 hour and 20 minutes.

The easiest way to get to Tolhuin is by taking a bus or a combi from Ushuaia.

Alternatively, if you feel comfortable renting a car in Argentina, you can do so.

Just keep in mind that most cars are manual and this is a windy road that involves crossing the Andes Mountain range at the bottom of the world.

However, if you’re only interested in visiting Tolhuin for the day, I would recommend booking a tour that takes care of transportation and sightseeing.

The back road that leads to Tolhuin

Tolhuin Day trip from Ushuaia

If you do decide to visit Tolhuin on a day trip, this full day 4x4 tour with an Argentine BBQ is the most popular option. 

This tour departs from Ushuaia, takes you to the Garibaldi Pass, which is the only paved route across the Fuegian Andes and also the highest point on Argentina’s Ruta Nacional 3.

From the Garibaldi Pass you get to see Lago Escondido which means 'hidden lake', and you then begin an off-roading adventure along the lake's edge and through the forest before reaching Lago Fagnano.

This tour ends with a traditional Argentine asado featuring choripán (chorizo on a bread bun), bife de chorizo (striploin steak), salad, Malbec wine and cheese.

You won't get to visit the actual town of Tolhuin, but you'll get to see some of the main attractions in the area as well as enjoy some Argentine hospitality with a delicious meal.

Where to stay in Tolhuin

If you would like to spend a few days in Tolhuin, I would recommend Hostería Kaiken, which is where we stayed.

This is a beautiful guesthouse set atop a cliff overlooking Lago Fagnano, and it offers hotel rooms in the main building as well as cottages up on the hill.

If you’re looking for a quiet place to relax and unwind in nature, this place fits the bill. It's one of the most underrated places to visit in Patagonia.

Views of Lago Fagnano from Hostería Kaiken

Hostería Kaiken sits on a cliff overlooking the lake

They also have an excellent restaurant on site called Restaurant Shelk'nam where you can enjoy all sorts of traditional Patagonian dishes.

The only downside is that it’s a long walk to town, but the hotel was always happy to call us a taxi.

Tolhuin is quite small and there are limited accommodations, so if you’re planning to visit during the summer season, it’s a good idea to book in advance.

Things to do in Tolhuin

Lago Fagnano

One of the big draws to Tolhuin is Lago Fagnano, a lake shared by both Argentina and Chile. It is known as Lago Cami on the Chilean side; the word Khami means 'large waters' to the Selk'nam people.

The lake is of glacial origins and it runs east to west stretching 98 kilometres, 72.5 km of which sit on the Argentine side of the border.

With Lago Fagnano, you never know what you're going to get! One day it could be calm as a mirror and another day the ferocious waves could make you think you're entering the Drake Passage!

Visiting Lago Fagnano in Tolhuin

When the lake is calm, kayaking is the activity of choice. Puerto Khami Extremo and Aventura Tolhuin are two local operators that offer kayak and canoe rentals.

If you really want to go kayaking, it’s a good idea to have some flexibility in your schedule and do this activity sooner rather than later. The weather is quite unpredictable around these parts, so make the most of those rare days with calm waters and clear skies.

Fishing is another popular activity, and if not, you can also enjoy a stroll along the pebbly shores.

Camping Hain

Perhaps one of the most unusual places you can visit in Tolhuin is Camping Hain.

Don’t be fooled by the name, even if you’re not planning to camp out by the lake, you’ll want to see what they’ve built here.

This place is an art project meets recycling centre meets junk yard, where somebody's trash is someone else's treasure.

Camping Hain is one of Tolhuin's attractions

Camping Hain in Tolhuin

Where somebody's trash is someone else's treasure

The family that runs this campsite has taken it upon themselves to reuse glass, plastic, wooden pallets and all sorts of random objects by repurposing them as art in this quirky outdoor gallery filled with the carcasses of old tractors, cars and planes.

It's hard to describe this place because it's not something you see every day, but for a small admission fee, you can tour the grounds, chat with the mastermind behind the place, and take some one-of-a-kind photos.

Laguna Negra Provincial Reserve

Another activity to enjoy in Tolhuin is hiking in the Laguna Negra Provincial Reserve.

This nature reserve sits on the northeast end of Lago Fagnano, and it is accessed via a coastal trail that begins at Camping Hain.

The hiking trail starts at the pier and follows the lake's coastline going across southern Fuegian forest, through peat bogs, and continues past the 'black lagoon' where it ends shortly thereafter.

Laguna Negra Provincial Reserve in Tolhuin

Fuegian forest and Laguna Negra

The trail is 3.9 kilometres in length, takes 2 hours to complete, and is considered low difficulty.

Another fun fact is that the Magallanes-Fagnano fault system runs through here, so you have the South America Tectonic Plate and the Scotia Tectonic Plate, which are slowly shifting a few centimetres each year. You'll notice a sign for it along your hike.

Where to eat in Tolhuin

La Posada de los Ramirez

If you happen to be in Tolhuin on a Sunday, La Posada de los Ramirez is the place to be!

This is asado or barbecue day at the restaurant and people come from as far as Ushuaia and Rio Gallegos to enjoy the meal which features Patagonian lamb, various cuts of meat, chorizo, morcilla and more. It's an event in and of itself.

Lunch at La Posada de los Ramirez

Sunday BBQ at La Posada de los Ramirez

Fret not if you find yourself here midweek, while there may be no BBQ, you can still order steak, seafood, pastas and more, so you certainly won't go hungry.

Restaurant Shelk'nam

This restaurant is located in Hostería Kaiken and it's worth a visit even if you're not staying there!

Restaurant Shelk'nam specializes in Patagonian dishes and the food quality is excellent. We ate there numerous times during our stay and managed to sample large part of their menu!

Sorrentinos stuffed with mushrooms and walnuts

Dining at Restaurant Shelk'nam

A delicious creamy shrimp chowder

We tried the creamy shrimp chowder, the sorrentinos stuffed with mushrooms and walnuts, the cheesy veggie lasagna served with a tomato and cream sauce.

Not to mention their chocolate volcano brownies with ice cream and their apple crumble.

And then the wine - every meal was paired with an exquisite bottle of red wine!

Plus the views were stunning; the dining room is set in a salon with large windows overlooking the ever-changing Lago Fagnano.

Panadería La Union

Panadería La Union is a very famous bakery in Tolhuin and it’s one of the main tourist attractions in town.

Buses completing the long journey from Rio Gallegos to Ushuaia tend to stop here for a break and to give people a chance to grab a bite.

Aside from being a tourist stop, the bakery is also well-frequented by locals who use it as a gathering place to meet up with friends, watch sports on television, and enjoy some delicious baked goods! Plus over the years it has welcomed all sorts of celebrities and even presidents.

The bakery experienced a horrific fire in January 2021 that destroyed the building, but the community rallied together (both locals and visitors alike) to raise funds, and it's now back bigger and better than ever.

Chipá are cheese bread balls made with cassava starch

Empanadas are stuffed meat pastries

So what can you eat at Panadería La Union? They have empanadas (stuffed meat pastries), facturas (viennoiserie), chipá (cheese bread balls), artisanal chocolate and more!

There are also some really friendly dogs who like to hang around the entrance and greet visitors, so don’t be shy and give them a pet!

So there you have it! If you're travelling in Ushuaia and you've already visited the post office at the end of the world, travelled aboard the train of prisoners, sailed the Beagle Channel, feasted on Fuegian cuisine, are in the mood to see a different side of Tierra del Fuego, visit Tolhuin!

Trelew is a city situated along the eastern part of the Province of Chubut in Argentina. Its name translates to 'town of Lewis' in honour of Welsh founder Lewis Jones. Yes, this is one of many towns in Patagonia founded by Welsh immigrants!

Trelew was founded in 1886 shortly after works for a railway line between the Chubut Valley and the port city of Puerto Madryn were approved in 1884. This became known as the end of the railway line right in the heart of the Welsh settlement. But we'll get to Welsh history later.

For now, if you want to go off the beaten track in coastal Patagonia, we want to share a few reasons why you should consider visiting Trelew! Aside from Welsh culture, this city also boasts some of the biggest dinosaurs on the planet, it is home to a hotel with links to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, plus it's a jumping-off point for day trips to a petrified forest, a geo park and a whole slew of Welsh communities in the area.

This destination doesn't receive a huge number of international visitors, so it feels like a bit of a diamond in the rough. The tourist attractions are few but they are quirky, and if you come with an open mind you're bound to have a good time!

So if this sounds like your kind of destination, read on for some ideas of things to do in Trelew, Argentina:

Things to do in Trelew, Argentina

Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum

If you want to see dinosaurs, Trelew needs to be on your list of places to go in Patagonia.

The museum visit begins in a gallery that focuses on the first human settlements in the area about ten thousand years ago, and it then jumps back in time to the Mesozoic era when dinosaurs roamed these lands.

There are over 30 dinosaurs on display at the Egidio Feruglio Paleontological Museum and you can even see some dinosaur eggs. However, no dinosaur is more famous than the Patagotitan Mayorum - the largest dinosaur in the world!

This titanosaur was discovered in early 2013 and it measures more than 8 metres in height, 40 metres in length, and is estimated to have weighed around 74 tons.

If you have time, the museum screens a dinosaur documentary narrated by David Attenborough and it plays a few times a day.

Biggest Dinosaur in the World Sculpture

If you still want to see more dinosaurs, you won’t want to miss the sculpture of the biggest dinosaur in the world on the outskirts of Trelew.

Head north on Ruta 3 just a few minutes outside of town, and you’ll spot the Patagotitan Mayorum on the left-hand side.

It’s located directly across from Trelew Airport and it’s massive, so you really can’t miss it!

It’s a short drive, so if you don’t have a car, you can always take a taxi and ask the driver to wait for you while you snap a few photos.

Hotel Touring Club

Trelew's Hotel Touring Club is known to have hosted many famous guests including writer and aviator Antoine de Saint Exupéry of The Little Prince. He was a frequent guest in the 1930s and today there’s a plaque that commemorates his stays.

It also hosted an infamous gang of bank and train robbers. Do the names Butch Cassidy, Sundance Kid and Ethel Place ring a bell?

They were on the run from US law enforcement and ended up in this remote corner of Patagonia. They bought land, set up a ranch in Cholila, and would come to Trelew for business. (You can still visit the Butch Cassidy Ranch if you make it to northwestern Chubut.)

It may not look like it today, but Hotel Touring Club was once considered one of Argentina’s most luxurious hotels. It was constructed in 1898 and remained the it place hosting multiple presidents through to the 1930s.

Today it oozes faded charm and stepping through its doors will transport you back to a different era.

Downstairs you can eat at the Touring Club Café with its wooden bar from a bygone era, walls covered in Butch Cassidy memorabilia, and bright fluorescent lights. The food is good, but we’ll get to that in the restaurant recommendations down below.

Regional Museum Pueblo de Luis

To learn a bit more about the history of Trelew, you can visit the Regional Museum Pueblo de Luis. The name really says it all: Pueblo de Luis is Spanish for Town of Lewis, which is Trelew in Welsh.

This museum is set in the former railway station which dates back to 1889. It tells the story of the Welsh immigrants who crossed the Atlantic Ocean, arrived on the shores of Puerto Madryn, and went on to settle the valley along the Chubut River.

The museum is split up into different rooms starting with the Mapuches and the Tehuelches who lived in these lands, followed by the early exploration of the area between 1520 and 1865, and then the arrival of Welsh immigrants.

You can see farming equipment, furniture, homewares and other items that would have been brought over from Wales by the early settlers.

Plaza Independencia

Another place to visit in Trelew is Plaza Independencia or Independence Square.

This plaza has a beautiful pavilion and is surrounded by centuries-old trees, so it’s a nice place to enjoy a quiet stroll.

It’s where many city events are held and sometimes there’s even live music.

Trelew Visual Arts Museum

Directly across from Plaza Independencia on the west side of the square, you'll find the Trelew Visual Arts Museum.

This museum showcases the work of local artists and the exhibition is constantly changing.

The works featured are mainly photography and paintings, and it makes for a short but enjoyable visit.

Cacique Chiquichano Lagoon

This lagoon is located in Trelew’s city centre directly behind the bus terminal.

There’s a 1.9-kilometre trail that goes all around the lake and it’s a nice place for a walk or a run if you're looking to get a workout during your visit.

You can also see swans, ducks and flamingos.

Day trips from Trelew

There are multiple day trips you can take from Trelew ranging from 20 minutes to just under 2 hours of driving time. These include:

Gaiman

Driving time: 20 minutes

Gaiman is the place to visit if you want to experience a Welsh town in Patagonia. The main thing to do in Gaiman is to enjoy Welsh afternoon tea in one of the town’s many tea houses. Some other highlights include visiting a local farm and learning about Welsh immigration to Argentina in the town’s various museums.

Rawson

Driving time: 20 minutes

Rawson was the first town founded by Welsh immigrants who sailed to Patagonia aboard the Mimosa in 1865. The city rises next to the Chubut River not too far from where it meets the sea. If you’re craving a beach day or want to do some dolphin or whale watching (season dependent) this is your destination.

Dolavon

Driving time: 30 minutes

Dolavon is another Welsh community you can visit in Chubut and its name translates to ‘river meadow’. This is a very small, sleepy town that can easily be visited in half a day. Some of the highlights include walking along the canals, and visiting the old mill turned museum and restaurant.

Bryn Gwyn Geopark

Driving time: 30 minutes

Bryn Gwyn Geopark is a natural geological reserve and its name translates to ‘white hill’ in Welsh. The park is in an area that separates the Chubut River valley from the Patagonian steppe. There is a hiking trail and along the way you can see fossils - both real and replicas.

Puerto Madryn

Driving time: 50 minutes

You’ll want more than a day to visit Puerto Madryn and Península Valdés, but if a day is all you have, a full-day excursion is the best way to do so. You’ll get to see this port city in passing and then continue towards the peninsula for some wildlife viewing. We’re talking penguins, sea lions, elephant seals and more!

Petrified Forest Florentino Ameghino

Driving time: 1 hour 50 minutes

If you don’t mind a bit of a drive, you can visit a petrified forest in the province of Chubut. Here you’ll come face to face with petrified logs that were part of an extensive forest that were carried by rivers to the sea coast of that time. The tree logs are estimated to date back 60 million years!

Punta Tombo

Driving time: 2 hours 10 minutes

You can also visit Punta Tombo National Reserve on a day trip. This is a narrow and rocky peninsula known for its Magellanic penguin colony. It's an alternative to Peninsula Valdes if you're looking for a destination with less tourism.

Where to eat in Trelew

Trelew offers a nice variety of restaurants featuring all your classic Argentine foods, and that means plenty of steak, pizza and pasta! Here is a list of restaurants we enjoyed in the city:

Sugar

Sugar is a gourmet restaurant specializing in Argentine cuisine with a contemporary twist. It is the best restaurant we visited in Trelew and it left us ooh-ing and ahh-ing at every bite! Their menu is ever evolving but we really enjoyed the smoke-infused steak and the beetroot gnocchi in a blue cheese sauce. A delightful foodie experience from start to finish.

Tía Camila

If you’re craving pizza, then make your way over to Tía Camila for some of the most delicious pizza you’ll ever have! This is very much a local eatery with prices to match. I’d recommend trying the Pizza Quattro Stagioni (Four Seasons Pizza), so you can sample 4 different pizza toppings.

Raíces

Another restaurant we visited in Trelew is Raíces, which specializes in pasta dishes. We tried the spinach and ricotta cannelloni with a tomato and beef sauce, as well as the plum and bacon-stuffed gnocchi in a creamy mushroom sauce. Pair that with a bottle of red wine and you’ve got yourself a wonderful meal!

Francesca

This is a cute cafe for breakfast or afternoon tea. They have all sorts of pies, tarts, cakes and pastries to choose from. If you're craving something savoury, you can't go wrong with their classic grilled ham and cheese sandwich. It's a relaxed setting where you can linger in between all the sightseeing.

Hotel Touring Club

We mentioned this place under the attractions, but don’t miss out on the chance to eat here. The vibe is a bar stuck in time and the food is good. I would recommend ordering the picada, which is Argentina’s version of a snack. Expect lots of little plates with salami, cheese, mortadella, olives, peanuts, chips, fries, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. Order a pint of beer to go with it and it’s a complete meal!

Where to stay in Trelew

Hotel Libertador - This is a centrally located 3-star hotel close to most attractions and offering breakfast.

Apart Hotel Argenta - These are spacious self-catering apartment-style accommodations with a kitchen, living and dining area.

La Casa de Paula Bed & Art - This is a bed and breakfast option set in a residential neighbourhood with a familiar touch.

Hotel Touring Club - If you’re visiting Trelew for its history and Butch Cassidy connection, then you may be interested in this hotel, however, keep in mind it is a 1-star hotel!

How to get to Trelew

Trelew has a small airport (Almirante Marcos A. Zar - REL), so it is possible to fly into the city. The national airline Aerolineas Argentinas operates a few weekly flights.

However, you’re most likely to arrive in Trelew by bus via the port city of Puerto Madryn. There are two bus companies that operate regular routes between Trelew and Puerto Madryn and those are Mar y Valle and 28 de Julio. The travel time between the two cities is 53 minutes.

If you feel comfortable driving in Argentina (keep in mind most cars have manual transmission!), an even better way to explore Trelew and the surrounding area is by renting a car. This will give you the flexibility to explore at your own pace without having to depend on public transport. Plus it'll make the day trips a lot more accessible.

That's our travel guide to visiting Trelew! Hopefully, this blog post gave you a few ideas of things to do and day trips to go on during your visit.

This rugged mountain town sits on the shores of the Percy River, is surrounded by epic mountains, boasts multiple vineyards, is within driving distance to a beautiful national park, and transforms into a fairy tale when the tulip fields bloom in the springtime.

Despite all it has to offer, Trevelin is still quite undiscovered by international tourists. However, if you enjoy venturing off the beaten path and exploring lesser-known destinations, Trevelin is one of those places in Patagonia worth adding to your list.

The following is our Trevelin travel guide, so get ready to take some notes for your visit.

History of Trevelin

In 1865, a group of Welsh immigrants embarked on a journey from Wales to Patagonia, seeking religious freedom and better economic opportunities. 

Led by Michael D. Jones, a Welsh nationalist and preacher, they arrived in the Chubut River Valley in Argentina, where they established several settlements, including the town of Trevelin, which translates to ‘mill town’ in Welsh. 

The Welsh settlers faced numerous challenges upon their arrival, including the harsh and unfamiliar Patagonian landscape and climate, and they only made it through those early years thanks to help of the Tehuelche people who taught them how to hunt and survive in this new climate. 

Over the years, the Welsh settlers in Trevelin managed to cultivate the fertile lands, engage in sheep farming, and build a thriving community. They also constructed traditional Welsh-style houses and chapels, which can still be seen in the town today, adding to its unique charm and cultural heritage. 

The descendants of the Welsh settlers in Trevelin are proud of their heritage and continue to honor their roots through various cultural events and festivals. 

The town’s legacy stands as a testament to the resilience and determination of the Welsh immigrants who ventured across the Atlantic Ocean to build a new life in the remote Patagonian wilderness.

Things to do in Trevelin

There are plenty of things to do in Trevelin, both within the town and in its vicinity. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Los Alerces National Park

Los Alerces National Park has various access points that allow you to explore different areas of the park.

You can access from El Bolson in the north, Esquel in the east, while Trevelin gives you access to the southern sector, which is home to the Futaleufú Hydroelectric Complex.

We decided to visit the park on a half-day trip and these are the places we were able to cover:

Cascada de los Tambores: short trail that leads to a waterfall.

Mirador de los Pozones: lookout point where you have turquoise pools along the river - this is a popular swimming spot in the summer.

Presa Futaleufú: a snaking road leads up to the dam where you can drive across and enjoy spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.

Bahía de Troncos: this is the 'bay of the logs' referring to the trees from the forest that was flooded during the creation of the dam.

Chimenea de Equilibrio: this chimney stands 62 meters high, has a 30-metre diameter, and its job is to regulate the water pressure. This stop also offers views of the abandoned hotel that once housed the foreign workers who helped build the hydroelectric complex.

Tip: If you're renting a car you can do this trip independently. Alternatively, you can hire a remís (private car and driver) to take you on a tour of the park, which is what we did. 

This is not a guided tour, but the driver will stop at all the scenic points and give you time to go on little hikes and take photos. 

If you speak some basic Spanish, you can approach one of the remís booths in town and inquire about this half-day outing.

Winery Visit

Patagonia has an emerging wine region, and Trevelin alone has 3 different vineyards you can visit:

Casa Yagüe

Viñas del Nant y Fall

Contra Corriente

We only had time to visit one vineyard and we went to Casa Yagüe, so we'll share that experience.

For starters, this vineyard is in a beautiful setting surrounded by snow-capped mountains, thick forests, and rows upon rows of vines.

Casa Yagüe is the second southernmost vineyard in the world - it's quite impressive that they can produce wine at these latitudes! - and it's just 12 kilometres from the border with Chile, meaning it's closer to Chile than it is to the town of Trevelin.

We signed up to have lunch and do the guided vineyard tour, and we loved the order of things - food and drink first, then tour the property!

For lunch, we enjoyed a delicious cheese plater with fruits and nuts. That was followed by a delicious fresh salad with local, seasonal veggies grown right in their garden. The main course was a homemade gnocchi with a beetroot sauce.

All of this was paired with complimentary wines!

And lastly, we had pancakes with dulce de leche for dessert.

Tip: It's best to make a reservation if you want to dine at the winery, especially if you're visiting during high season as seating is limited. You can either call or send a message through Whatsapp and they're good about messaging back the same day. 

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Museo Molino Nant Fach (@museo_molino_nant_fach) 

Nant Fach Mill

Another popular attraction in Trevelin, or rather its outskirts, is Molino Nant Fach.

This mill is an exact replica of the flour mills that existed in Trevelin from the late 19th century up until the mid-20th century.

In fact, this mill was built by Mervyn Evans, one of the direct descendants of Trevelin's early Welsh settlers.

The mill itself looks like something out of a fairy tale. It's a picturesque log construction complete with a waterwheel and a sparkling stream that can be crossed via a cute footbridge.

Guided tours are offered and it's a great opportunity to learn about Patagonia's Welsh heritage.

Tip: It's best to check the mill's hours of operation at the Visitor Centre in Trevelin's town square since this changes month to month. 

Nant y Fall Waterfalls

The Nant y Fall Waterfalls are located just south of Trevelin off of Route 259.

It's then a 4-kilometre drive from the turn-off until you reach the trailhead, where you pay a small admission fee.

The whole circuit is about a 500-metre walk along a well-marked trail that leads to a couple of different lookout points where you can view the different waterfalls including La Petisa meaning 'the short one', Las Mellizas meaning 'the twins', and El Salto Grande or 'the big jump'.

There's also a small shop at the entrance just as soon as you cross the bridge where you can buy cold drinks, sandwiches, cookies, scones, and other snacks.

This place is located quite close to the Nant Fach Mill, so you can hit up both attractions if you’re in the area. 

Andean Mill Museum

If you want to dive into Patagonia's Welsh history, I would recommend visiting the Museo Regional Trevelin Molino Andes.

They have the list of passengers who arrived from Wales aboard the Mimosa in 1865, photos of the early settlers, and all sorts of farming equipment and homeware goods that would have been used by the newly arrived in their new home.

Tip: This is a great attraction for a rainy day and you can combine it with Welsh afternoon tea on the same day.

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tulipanes Patagonia (@tulipanespatagonia) 

Tulipanes Patagonia

This next attraction is a seasonal one, but if you happen to be travelling in Patagonia in the springtime, then you can't miss visiting the tulip fields!

Tulipanes Patagonia is located in the outskirts of town just south of Trevelin and during peak bloom, it draws visitors from all over the country.

They organize all sorts of cool events during this brief month-long window; you can enjoy the views of the tulip fields from a hot air balloon, you can fly over in a small plane, or you can even attend a moonlit dinner in the fields.

If your trip happens to coincide with these dates, it's a sight you cannot miss!

Tip: MerakiSur runs an excursion to see the tulip fields from Esquel during the month of October. If you miss that, they also run an excursion to see the peonies in bloom at a neighbouring plantation starting in mid-November. The fresh blooms last about a month.

Welsh Fire-breathing Dragon

One of the unique things to do in Trevelin is to wait for the fire-breathing dragon to wake up!

That's right! Seated atop the town's tourism office on the north end of the plaza is a red dragon that comes to life twice a day and breathes three fiery puffs.

It's a bit of a blink-and-you-miss-it experience, so have your camera ready to go.

The schedule is posted to the left of the tourism office just under the dragon, so check the times because they change throughout the year.

Shop at El Caballo

There's a shop located on the northwest end of the central plaza called El Caballo, and it's a great place to pick up some typical Argentine souvenirs.

They have all sorts of leather goods ranging from belts to boots, sombreros to boinas, ponchos to wool sweaters, and knives to mates.

It's a really cool store and the staff are really helpful, speak English, and can help you find what you need.

Where to Stay in Trevelin

Casa de Piedra - here you'll find centrally-located alpine-style accommodations featuring a main guesthouse and cottages, plus a buffet breakfast.

La Estancia - they offer log and stone cabins in a quiet neighbourhood just a few blocks from the centre of town.

Ladera de Nant y Fall - this is a holiday home on the outskirts of town, right across from the tulip fields and a vineyard, and just down the road from the hike to the Nant y Fall waterfalls. Keep in mind you would need a rental car since it's not within walking distance of town.

Nomade Glamping y Domos - a glamping site overlooking the shores of the Futaleufú River in Los Cipreses, about 25 kilometres from Trevelin. You can find more glamping spots in Trevelin and across Patagonia here.

Where to Eat in Trevelin

Los Troncos

Los Troncos is a traditional parrilla restaurant, so the focus here is grilled meats.

If you order the parrillada para uno or 'BBQ for one', you'll get an assortment of classic cuts of meats, including chorizo (sausage), morcilla (blood sausage), bife (steak), asado de tira (short ribs), chinchulín (small intestine), and more.

They'll bring a small grill to your table with the meat still sizzling, that way the meat stays warm while you dine.

Pair that with a salad and a bottle of Malbec, and you've got yourself a traditional Argentine barbecue!

Address: Avenida San Martín 214

El Refugio

If you're craving pizza, you need to eat at El Regufio. This pizzeria is located on the northwest corner of the central plaza in a cozy log cabin-style building, complete with a fireplace.

We tried a really interesting pizza with blue cheese, walnuts and celery, which sounds really odd, but we quite enjoyed the mix of flavours and textures.

For something a bit more classic, you can't go wrong ordering their Napolitana with mozzarella, tomato slice, garlic and oregano.

Address: Avenida Fortin Refugio across from the plaza

De la Cabaña

This place does take out food, so it's a nice option if you want to get an Argentine homecooked meal to enjoy at your cottage.

It's buffet style, so you just grab a box, fill it up with what you want, have it weighed and pay.

They usually have a mix of chicken, beef, pizza, pasta, salads, and a couple of vegetarian options like stuffed pumpkin, roasted squash, eggplant and more.

They also have a couple of tables outdoors on the sidewalk, so you can eat there if the weather is nice.

Address: Perito Moreno 215

Nain Maggie

Nain Maggie translates to 'Grandma Margaret' in Welsh and it's named after the matriarch who first opened the teahouse in 1975 in order to share the Welsh flavours of her ancestors.

The specialize in Welsh cake or bara brith, which is served in the tea house but can also be purchased to take away.

Their afternoon tea is copious with homemade bread, butter, jams, cheeses, scones, and an assortment of freshly baked cakes.

Definitely skip lunch and make this your main meal.

Address: Perito Moreno 179

Casa de Té La Mutisia

This is another alternative for a Welsh afternoon tea in Trevelin.

You can expect a similar menu featuring scones, Welsh cake, and a few other baked items, with the addition of grilled sandwiches.

This place feels slightly fancier than the previous tea house, and it also has a mini museum on site with displays of items that belonged to the early Welsh settlers.

Address: Avenida San Martín 170

Day Trips from Trevelin

There are a variety of day trips from Trevelin ranging from half an hour to two hours away, and one is even across the border in neighbouring Chile!

Esquel

Driving time: 28 minutes

There are plenty of things to do in Esquel and you could easily spend a few days there, but if one day is all you have, you can visit on a day trip from Trevelin.

Some activities not to miss include riding the Old Patagonian Express, kayaking on Laguna La Zeta, biking to Laguna Willmanco, and hiking up Cerro La Cruz for panoramic views of the town.

Los Alerces National Park

Driving time: 1 hour 15 minutes

I've already mentioned you can visit the southern sector of Los Alerces National Park from Trevelin, however, the area around Pasarela Río Arrayanes (accessed via Esquel) is really nice.

You can book a guided tour that departs from Puerto Chucao, cruises up Lake Menendez, and then disembarks in Puerto Sagrario where you can hike through Valdivian forest and see a 2,700 year old tree!

Cholila

Driving time: 2 hours

The main draw to Cholila is to visit the famous ranch once inhabited by Butch Cassidy, Etta Place and the Sundance Kid.

This wild gang of former bank and train robbers ended up hiding out in Patagonia, and their former ranch still stands today.

There's an interesting museum of sorts showcasing all thing Butch Cassidy and the Wild Gang, and it's a quirky stop in this remote corner of Patagonia.

Futaleufú, Chile

Driving time: 1 hour (may take longer with border crossing)

If you're up to visit another country, you can cross the border into neighbouring Chile!

This small frontier town is located just 10 kilometres from the international border and it has a slowly burgeoning tourism scene where travellers can enjoy hiking, fishing, mountain biking, trekking and canyoning.

Just don't forget to bring your passport if you decide to go on this day trip!

Ushuaia is one of those destinations that feels like a major accomplishment as a traveller. After all, it takes a lot of effort and planning to reach the southernmost city in the world, so when you get there, you want to make sure you're making the most of your trip!

During my very first trip to Ushuaia, I spent an action-packed 2 weeks there. I visited all the main attractions as well as some lesser-known sites, I did a lot of hiking, went on day tours, stayed at a few different accommodations and restaurant-hopped my way across the city.

As a result, I feel like I have a really good understanding of everything there is to do in Ushuaia! 

Today, I want to share everything I know about this destination to help you have the most amazing time there. In this massive Ushuaia travel guide, I'm going to tell you the best things to do in Ushuaia, how to get there, fun day trips and hikes you can go on, where to stay in the city, and the best time to visit.

It's a lot of information, but as it turns out, there's a lot to do at the End of the World. Now let's dive in!

How to get to Ushuaia

Getting to Ushuaia can be quite an adventure, depending on the mode of transportation you choose.

The quickest and most straightforward option is to fly into Aeropuerto Internacional Malvinas Argentinas. There are multiple daily flights from Buenos Aires, though you can also get flights from some other major Argentine cities during high season. 

The flight from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia is 3 hours and 40 minutes.

The next option is bus travel, which makes more sense if you're already travelling in southern Patagonia (around El Calafate or El Chaltén). The bus journey does involve going through Chile (a good excuse to stop over in Torres del Paine National Park!) and it also includes a ferry crossing.

You can read our detailed guide on how to get to Ushuaia here.

Things to do in Ushuaia, Argentina

First up, let's dive into the top attractions in Ushuaia you won't want to miss during your visit!

Cruise the Beagle Channel

One of the top things to do in Ushuaia is to go on a boat cruise of the Beagle Channel and enjoy the wildlife at the bottom tip of South America!

The Beagle Channel is the strait that separates Isla Grande, the main island of Tierra del Fuego, from various smaller islands. Plus, the channel also acts as a border between Chile and Argentina. This is one of three navigable bodies of water that act as a passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean at the bottom of South America; the two others are the Straits of Magellan to the north and the open-ocean Drake Passage to the south.

There are numerous Beagle Channel tours to choose from, ranging from catamarans to sailboats, but all afford the opportunity to view seabirds, sea lions and penguins! One tour even lets you walk amongst penguins on Martillo Island, though keep in mind this one needs to be booked in advance as only a very small number of visitors are allowed on Isla Martillo each day.

You also get to cruise past the famous Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse, an iconic red and white-striped lighthouse that stands 11 metres high on a rocky outcrop some 5 nautical miles east of Ushuaia.

It is locally known as 'the Lighthouse at the End of the World', but that title officially belongs to the San Juan de Salvamento lighthouse, which was made famous by Jules Verne in the novel The Lighthouse at the End of the World, and is located on Isla de los Estados much further east.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to go inside Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse, however, a Beagle Channel tour is a great opportunity to see it up close, and the captain does linger in the area so tourists can take their photos.

Tip: Make sure you bring your passport on the boat cruise because staff will come around and offer you a stamp of the Beagle Channel. 

Pose at the Fin del Mundo sign

Every traveller in Ushuaia has to pose next to the Fin del Mundo sign, literally the 'End of the World' sign. This is kind of like a right of passage to prove you made it to the southernmost city in the world. The sign is on the waterfront right next to the tourist pier where all the Beagle Channel cruises depart from.

Tour Ushuaia by Double-Decker Bus

One fun way to experience Ushuaia is by going on a double-decker bus tour of the city. This is a great activity to do at the very start of your trip so you can get an idea of the lay of the land.

The bus tour is 1 hour and 10 minutes in length and it's an opportunity to enjoy views of the Beagle Channel, soak in the beauty of the surrounding mountain peaks, and cruise the city streets.

This is done as an audio tour where guests receive a headset and can learn about Ushuaia's history in 8 different languages.

This hour-long Ushuaia double-decker bus tour provides a good overview of the city beyond the top tourist sites.

Visit the Old Ushuaia Prison

One of Ushuaia’s main attractions is the Prison at the End of the World, also known as the Ushuaia Prison. This is because the city of Ushuaia was founded as a penal colony, with the first prisoners arriving in 1884.

The prison was in operation between 1902 and 1947 and was known for its harsh conditions, meaning it was damp, humid and cold. Not the kind of place you’d want to end up.

Today, the prison has been turned into a tourist site, and it houses multiple museums. The prison’s five wings converge in a central hall and each wing holds a different museum.

These include the Prison Museum, which focuses on the stories of the prisoners; the Maritime Museum, where you can see scale models of vessels that would have sailed the waters in this part of the world; the Antarctic Museum, which highlights the age of exploration and scientific expeditions; the Art Museum, showcasing a collection of maritime-inspired art; and the Art Gallery, where local artists can showcase and sell their artwork.

There's a lot to see here, so give yourself at least a couple of hours to visit the various wings and exhibits.

Hike Tierra del Fuego National Park

No trip to Ushuaia would be complete without visiting Tierra del Fuego National Park, the southernmost national park in Argentina.

The park is located just 11 kilometres west of Ushuaia, so it's fairly easy to get there either by shuttle or joining a guided tour.

The park is renowned for its hiking trails, which range from easy walks to more challenging treks, with the most famous being the Pampa Alta Trail and the Coastal Path.

You can also expect to see beavers in Tierra del Fuego National Park. These are not native to Argentina but they were introduced to the region in 1946 in an attempt by the Argentine government to generate a fur trade; that was an environmental disaster!

Send mail from the Southernmost Post Office

One place you cannot miss when you visit Tierra del Fuego National Park is the post office at the end of the world.

Made of corrugated metal and wood, this tiny post office sits atop a pier on the shores of the Beagle Channel, and it’s the last chance to send mail before reaching Antarctica.

The exterior is plastered with stickers from travellers who’ve reached this place from all corners of the world, and inside the walls are covered in postcards, maps, magnets and currencies from faraway lands.

Aside from sending mail, this is one of several places in Ushuaia where you can get your passport stamped, so don't forget to bring your passport.

It does cost a few dollars ($2.50 USD when we were there), but it's a full page with several stamps, and it's a special souvenir from your time visiting the city at the end of the world.

In my experience, it can take about 3 weeks for international mail to reach its final destination, so be patient if you send mail. 

Ride the Train at the End of the World

One of the best things to do in Ushuaia for train enthusiasts is to ride the Southern Fuegian Railway, also known as the Train at the End of the World!

Once upon a time, this was known as the train of prisoners. As we mentioned earlier, Ushuaia started out as a penal colony and prisoners were put to work building their own prison. This meant transporting rock and timber from the nearby forests to the town, first using oxen-pulled wagons, and eventually, this narrow-gauge railway.

Today, the train has been developed into a heritage train, and it’s considered the southernmost functioning railway in the world.

The journey begins at the Train Station at the End of the World and then crosses the Cañadón del Toro (Bull's Canyon) and the Pipo River over the Puente Quemado (Burnt Bridge).

The train then makes a stop at La Macarena Waterfall Station, where visitors can climb out to a viewpoint and see the waterfall.

The journey continues to the boundary with Tierra del Fuego National Park where you can witness peat bogs and the tree cemetery, a collection of stumps left from nearly half a century of cutting down forest to supply the town with firewood - a job that was done by the prisoners.

Lastly, the train reaches Tierra del Fuego National Park where visitors have the option of remaining in the park or completing the journey back.

This guided tour includes a ride aboard the End of the World Train and a visit to Tierra del Fuego National Park. It also includes transportation there and back. 

Reach the End of the Road in Lapataia Bay

I've included a lot of signs to pose next to in Ushuaia, and I'm about to share one more: Lapataia Bay.

So what's the significance of Lapataia Bay? Well, this is officially where the road ends. It is the southernmost point you can drive in the Western Hemisphere, and there is a sign marking the end of National Route 3, which is the last leg of the Pan-American Highway.

From this point, you'd have to drive 17,848 kilometres to reach the opposite end of the road in Alaska. I think that's worth a photo op!

Take a Helicopter tour over Ushuaia

One unforgettable way to experience Ushuaia is by taking a helicopter tour to soak in the views of the southernmost city in the world, perfectly framed by the Andes Mountains.

This activity may sound like a bit of a splurge, and it can be if you opt for a landing in the mountains followed by a champagne toast, however, you can also take a short scenic flight over the city and not break your budget.

HeliUshuaia is the local helicopter tour operator and offers three different flight options: a 7-minute flight over Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel, a 15-minute flight that goes as far as Laguna Esmeralda, or a 30-minute flight that takes you even further into the Andes Mountains with a landing and bubbly to celebrate.

Tip: Book your helicopter tour early on in your visit in case it case to be rescheduled due to weather.

Visit Galeria Tematica de Historia Fueguina

Note: This attraction recently closed, but we will update you if it re-opens in a different location.

Another unique museum we visited was the Galería Temática Historia Fueguina. This is a museum featuring dioramas and lifelike figures that showcase the history of the province of Tierra del Fuego.

The visit is done as a self-guided tour with an audio guide, so you can go at your own pace.

The tour starts out by sharing the history of the indigenous people who lived in this area, which included: the Yamanas, who were coastal hunter-gatherers and fishers, known for their canoe-building skills; the Shelknam, who were nomads, guanaco hunters, and renowned for their use of the bow and arrow; and the Haush, who are the least known of the three groups and lived in the southernmost part of the island which has a lot of peat bogs.

The tour then moves on to the early exploration and colonization of Tierra del Fuego. It also has sections focusing on the HMS Beagle, Ushuaia’s early beginnings as a penal colony, and Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance.

We found the museum to be very educational, and it’s especially worth the visit if you can take the time to listen to the audio guide.

Check out some lesser-known museums

If you get some bad weather days and are looking for some rainy day activities, consider visiting some smaller and lesser-known museums in town.

First, you have Museo del Fin del Mundo, or End of the World Museum, which is located inside the old Government House.

The museum is focused on a variety of topics, including local history and natural history, with exhibits on sailing, whaling, seabirds & more.

There's also a small botanical garden right next to the museum, which can be really nice in the summertime when the flowers are in bloom.

Sample traditional Fuegian cuisine

If you're a foodie, one of the best things to do in Ushuaia is to try Fuegian food, showcasing dishes native to Tierra del Fuego.

Given the proximity to the sea, seafood is a fundamental part of the Fuegian diet. This included fish such as sea bass, hake, and mackerel. Plus, shellfish like mussels, clams, and sea urchins. And we cannot forget King crab, which is locally known as centolla.

Patagonian lamb is another food staple of the region, given the number of estancias in the area. You'll find lamb served at numerous parilla restaurants specializing in grilled meats.

As for desserts, you'll notice lots of calafate berries on the menu. These are small berries that grow on bushes and they're used in ice creams, cakes, smoothies, you name it!

You can check out our list of where to eat in Ushuaia for some restaurant recommendations.

View the Saint Christopher shipwreck

There are quite a few landmarks you can visit while walking along the waterfront in Ushuaia, and one of the more famous vessels here is the San Cristóbal, or Saint Christopher, which sits on the shores of the Beagle Channel.

Once known as the HMS Justice, this was a Royal Navy ship classified as a rescue tug and it served at the Normandy landings during World War 2.

When the war ended, the ship was sold and renamed Saint Christopher, where it was chartered for salvage operations in Beagle Channel.

After suffering engine trouble and rudder damage, it was eventually beached and abandoned on the shores of Ushuaia.

Now Saint Christopher can be admired from shore, though no one is permitted aboard.

Pose at the Ushuaia city sign

So many signs and so many photo ops, but that's Ushuaia for you. Another spot you cannot miss is the Ushuaia city sign located on the waterfront right across from Plaza Islas Malvinas.

This is the classic city sign you'll encounter in numerous cities across Argentina. It does change up a little bit during the year, mainly during the Christmas holidays when the giant U sports a Santa Claus hat.

Typically, a line of tourists will form. You will take a photo for the person ahead of you and the next person in line will do the favour of taking your picture for you.

Hikes in Ushuaia

There are plenty of hiking opportunities in and around Ushuaia, both in Tierra del Fuego National Park and in the city outskirts. We're going to highlight some of the best hikes in Ushuaia, ranging in length and level of difficulty.

Senda Costera

The Senda Costera or Coastal Path is a hike known for its breathtaking coastal views. The trail is approximately 8 kilometres long and is considered a moderately easy hike. It typically takes around 3 to 4 hours to complete the hike, making it suitable for hikers of various skill levels.

Hikers can expect to see stunning vistas of the Beagle Channel, come across beautiful pebbly coves, and hike through Southern Fuegian forest.

This coastal trail runs from Zaratiegui Bay to Alakush, so you can get dropped off at either starting point and hike in either direction. I would recommend hiking from Zaratiegui Bay to Alakush since there's a cafe at the end where you can enjoy a hot meal at the end of the trek. That's how we did this particular hike.

The trail is flat most of the way, though you do gain some elevation as you approach Alakush.

Laguna Esmeralda

This is a popular day hike that leads to a lagoon with emerald waters surrounded by mountains. The hike is 8.7-km out-and-back but the hiking time greatly varies depending on the time of year and the ground conditions.

During the summer, this hike can be done in 2.5-3 hours, but once the trail is covered in snow and ice, the same hike could take 4-5 hours.

The trail can get quite muddy as you need to cross a fairly large swamp, followed by a steep hike with rocks, but the reward is an impressive emerald lagoon at the end.

Trekking poles and crampons are recommended if you're attempting this hike outside the summer months.

If you feel safer doing this with a guide, you can join a guided trek to Laguna Esmeralda. 

Martial Glacier

The glacier atop the Martial Mountains is named after Captain Ferdinand Martial of the Cap Horn Scientific Mission, a French expedition that arrived in Tierra del Fuego in September 1882.

This hike is 6.3 km out-and-back and is considered a moderate hike. The only thing that tends to disappoint some visitors is that you won't find an impressive glacier! Much of what you see is a moraine, the rocks and sediment carried down and deposited by a glacier that once existed. 

You can start this hike from Refugio de Montaña Glaciar Martial. Right across, you'll see La Cabaña de Té, a cute tea house where you can enjoy some sandwiches, cookies, pastries and a hot beverage either before or after your hike.

Vinciguerra Glacier and Laguna de los Témpanos

The Vinciguerra Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in Tierra del Fuego, situated in the Andes Mountains about 20 kilometres northwest of Ushuaia.

The trail to Vinciguerra Glacier is quite varied, going through dense forests, peat bogs, and stretches of rocky terrains.

It's considered a moderately challenging hike that takes anywhere between 4 to 6 hours round trip, depending on the weather conditions and the group's hiking pace.

At the base of the Vinciguerra Glacier, you'll find Laguna de los Témpanos. This is a glacial lagoon with floating icebergs that break off from the glacier above.

While the Vinciguerra Glacier can be accessed year-round, the best hiking window is in the summertime from December to March when the weather is milder and the paths are less treacherous. 

You can visit the Vinciguerra Glacier with a small group guided tour. 

Laguna del Caminante

For a more challenging hike in Ushuaia, you have Laguna del Caminante. This is a 24 km point-to-point trail through Tierra del Fuego National Park that can take anywhere between 8 to 13 hours to complete, depending on the conditions and the time of year.

Some people opt to hike Laguna del Caminante as a 2-day trek, renting a tent and sleeping bag in town and then camping next to the lagoon.

If you're not a very experienced hiker, you'll want to book a guide for this hike. It's fairly remote and you're not likely to encounter other hikers along the way.

Day trips from Ushuaia

Tolhuin

One of the most popular side trips from Ushuaia is the lakeside town of Tolhuin. Located 1 hour and 10 minutes away from Ushuaia, this is a destination that can either be visited as a day trip, or if you want to linger in a quiet town, you can easily spend 2-3 days here. 

The main attraction is Lago Fagnano, a lake of glacial origin that stretches across both Argentina and Chile. When the waters are calm, this is a nice place to go kayaking. There are also lakeside trails to explore in Laguna Negra Provincial Reserve. 

Essentially, this is a place to completely disconnect, enjoy the remoteness of it all, and unwind after a few days in Ushuaia. You can get some ideas of things to do in Tolhuin here.

Estancia Harberton

Estancia Harberton is the most famous estancia in Tierra del Fuego province. It is located about 1 hour and 25 minutes east of Ushuaia, with most of the journey being on a gravel road.

The estancia dates back to 1886, when it was founded by Reverend Thomas Bridges, an English missionary who worked with the indigenous Yámana people and who was also the author of the dictionary of the Yámana language. The Argentine government granted him this land in appreciation of his services.

The estancia or ranch covers some 50,000 acres of predominantly sheep-grazing land, interspersed with patches of native forests, and it is bordered by the Beagle Channel.

Within the estancia grounds, you'll also find the Acatushún Museum, which is focused on marine mammals and birds; it’s especially famous for its collection of marine mammal skeletons.

The best way to visit Estancia Haberton is by joining a guided tour, which includes transportation to and from the ranch.

Paso Garibaldi

The Garibaldi Pass is the only paved route across the Fuegian Andes and also the highest point on Argentina’s Ruta Nacional 3. 

It's a beautiful winding journey over the mountains with a breathtaking lookout along the way, where you can spot Lago Escondido, which translates to ‘hidden lake’.

You can rent a car and drive this route, however, for an even better experience, I would recommend doing the 4x4 overland tour that goes along the lake’s edge and through the forest, eventually reaching Lago Fagnano. 

Because this is Argentina, you shouldn't be too surprised that the tour concludes with a traditional Argentine BBQ featuring choripán, bife de chorizo, salad, Malbec wine, and cheese.

Where to stay in Ushuaia

Ushuaia offers a range of accommodations to suit different budgets and preferences ranging from luxury to mid-range to budget-friendly options. Here are some places to consider:

Arakur Ushuaia Resort & Spa

For those looking for a taste of luxury, you cannot go wrong with Arakur Ushuaia Resort & Spa. This is considered the best hotel in Ushuaia and because it's perched on a mountain, it offers great views of the Beagle Channel and the city below.

For more accommodation options, read our complete guide on where to stay in Ushuaia for all budgets. Keep in mind that Ushuaia is a popular tourist destination, so it's a good idea to book your accommodations in advance, especially if you're visiting during the peak summer season.

Antarctica Cruises from Ushuaia

There are two types of travellers in Ushuaia: those who are here to experience the city at the end of the world and those who have a cruise to catch because they're going all the way to Antarctica! If you're in the second category, you are one lucky traveller.

There are all sorts of cruises departing for Ushuaia, some which detour over to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and others that cruise the Antarctic Peninsula.

Here are 4 different Antarctica cruises to consider:

Antarctica Classic (11 days)

Antarctica Classic in Depth (13 days)

Quest for the Antarctic Circle (14 days)

Spirit of Shackleton (21 days)

You can find last-minute Antarctica cruises in Ushuaia. You'll typically see these advertised in the windows of tour agencies or on posters on the street.

The prices are low, but the issue is that you may need to be ready to get on a cruise the next day, or you may have to wait around for a couple of weeks.

If you can, it's better to book in advance and to book during a sale.

Best time to visit Ushuaia

Ushuaia is a destination that can be visited year-round, but the best time to visit depends on your personal interests and what you're hoping to do during your tip. Here's a breakdown of what each season in Ushuaia has to offer:

Summer in Ushuaia (December to February)

This is the peak tourist season in Ushuaia.

The weather is relatively mild with temperatures ranging from 41°F / 5°C to 59°F / 15°C.

Days are long with plenty of daylight for outdoor activities.

It's the best time for hiking, wildlife watching, and boat tours to nearby islands.

This is also the time of year when cruise ships depart for Antarctica (a very short window).

Fall in Ushuaia (March to May)

Fall is a quieter time to visit Ushuaia, with fewer tourists.

The weather begins to cool down and you can experience the beautiful fall foliage.

Wildlife is still active, and it's a good time for birdwatching.

Prices for accommodations and tours are lower compared to the summer months.

Winter in Ushuaia (June to August)

Winter in Ushuaia is cold and snowy.

This is the best time for winter sports enthusiasts, as you can go skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the nearby mountains - Cerro Castor is the it destination for winter sports. 

The city itself has a cosy atmosphere during this time, with many indoor activities and restaurants to enjoy.

Keep in mind that some attractions and tours may be limited during the winter season.

Many of the hiking trails close during the winter months.

Spring in Ushuaia (September to November):

Spring is a transitional season, with temperatures gradually warming up.

This is a good time for hiking and enjoying the changing landscapes as plants and flowers begin to bloom.

Wildlife becomes more active as well, making it a great time for nature enthusiasts.

Similar to fall, spring is less crowded than the summer months.

Ultimately, the best time to visit Ushuaia depends on your interests and the activities you want to pursue. If you want to experience milder weather and long daylight hours for outdoor adventures, consider visiting during the summer. If you prefer a quieter and more budget-friendly trip, fall and spring can be excellent choices. And if you're a winter sports enthusiast, the snowy months of June to August are ideal.

Travel tips for visiting Ushuaia

Pack for winter, no matter what time of year you're visiting. This may sound a bit extreme, but you are travelling to the city at the end of the world, and that means you can experience rain, snow, sleet and sunshine all in one day.

Plan for a few bad weather days. There will be days when the weather will be too unpleasant to spend long periods of time outside. Save your museum visits and restaurant hopping for these days.

Splurge on a few activities. There are certain tours and activities in Ushuaia that can be on the pricier side and you may be tempted to skip them, but ask yourself, when are you planning to come back to Ushuaia again? It takes quite a bit of effort to get here, so don't miss out on the things you really want to do during your visit.

Reserve popular excursions in advance. This is especially important if you're visiting Ushuaia during the summer months when the majority of tourists descend on the southernmost city. If there's a tour you really want to do, don't wait until the very last minute because it could be sold out.

Bring hiking boots and trekking poles. That is if you plan to go hiking, of course. This isn't a running shoes type of destination. Trails can get muddy and there are also lots of peat bogs, so bring adequate hiking gear. Collapsible trekking poles can be really helpful if you're planning some longer and more challenging hikes.

Give yourself at least 3 days in Ushuaia. This is the minimum amount of time you should spend in the city, as there really is so much to see and do! Also, keep in mind that the weather can affect flights, and you don't want to be cutting it close, especially if you have a cruise to catch.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,a5cab03f32af1fde17d3c89a9068fce54d5ed824

Easy Hikes in El Chalten

These hikes are perfect for beginners, families, or travellers looking to warm up for bigger adventures. They offer excellent views with minimal elevation gain.

1. Mirador del Cóndor

Distance: 2.6 km round-trip

Elevation: 129 metres

Time: 45 minutes to 1 hour

Difficulty: Easy

Mirador del Cóndor, also known as the Condor Lookout, is one of the most accessible short hikes in El Chaltén, offering a rewarding viewpoint with minimal time commitment. The trail begins behind the Centro de Visitantes (Park Ranger Station) and stretches just 2.6 kilometres round-trip, taking about 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete.

The path climbs gently through lenga shrubs and open terrain, making it easy for hikers of all levels. Yes, it's a bit steep at times, but it's a short distance. We saw families with young children tackling this hiking trail, so that gives you an idea of the level of difficulty.

We chose to do this hike on the very first day we arrived in El Chalten from El Calafate to warm up for the bigger treks ahead. We went up in the late afternoon just in time to catch sunset, and we were not disappointed.

At the viewpoint, we were treated to views of the town of El Chaltén, the Río de las Vueltas Valley and Mount Fitz Roy dominating the horizon - the latter was a very cool and unexpected surprise!

If you're lucky, you may even spot Andean condors soaring overhead, hence the name of the trail. 

2. Mirador del Águila

Distance: 7.2 kilometres loop trail

Elevation: 213 metres

Time: 2 hours

Difficulty: Easy

Mirador del Águila is a 7.2-kilometre hike that can be done as an extension to the above-mentioned Mirador del Condor.

The start of the hike is the same, and once you reach the Condor Lookout, you continue on a loop that brings you to another lookout point with views of Lago Viedma.

Aside from the initial ascent, this is a relatively flat and gentle trail, making it ideal for a relaxing outing. If you're looking for a sunrise hike, I would recommend this one. 

There are fewer crowds and a greater chance of spotting native birds like the carancho or the black-chested buzzard-eagle. You can also expect to encounter some free-roaming cows along the way!

3. Chorrillo del Salto

Difficulty: Easy

Elevation: 139 metres

Distance: 1 km (trail from parking lot) or 7 km if walking from town

Time: 30–45 minutes

This short, flat trail in El Chaltén leads to a picturesque 20-meter waterfall tucked away in the lenga forest. It's easily accessible by car (there's a parking lot right by the falls) or bike (you can cycle from town) and is ideal for families or travellers who want a quick nature fix.

The downside of the Chorrillo del Salto hike is that most of the trail is along Provincial Route 23, a dirt road that gets some vehicle traffic, which left us walking in a cloud of dust.

We hiked all the way from town, so we found it lacked the charm of hiking in the middle of nature. That being said, the waterfall is nice, and it's one of the easier and more accessible hikes in El Chalten.

4. Mirador Cascada Margarita

Distance: 1.4 kilometres

Elevation: 80 metres

Time: Under 1 hour

Difficulty: Easy

Another easy hike in El Chalten is Mirador Cascada Margarita. This is a short hike that leads to a viewpoint where you can see Margarita Waterfall across the canyon. 

To do this hike, you take the Laguna Torre trailhead and do the first segment of the trail until you reach the 0.7-kilometre mark. This lookout point is the first stop of the much longer Laguna Torre trek, plus you also get your first glimpse of Cerro Torre. 

We completed this hike on our way to Laguna Torre, however, you can do it as a quick standalone hike.

5. Sendero Río de las Vueltas

Distance: 3 km round-trip

Elevation: 106 metres

Time: 1 hour

Difficulty: Easy

Sendero Río de las Vueltas is another easy hike in El Chalten. It's on the way to Laguna Capri and Laguna de los Tres, so you'll cover it if you're doing either of those hikes. 

The downside of Sendero Río de las Vueltas is that it can be quite busy in the morning when hikers set out to complete some of the longer hikes. You may find yourself hiking in single file, but the crowds eventually disperse. We stopped to rest on the log benches at this lookout point.

This hike offers beautiful panoramic views of Río de las Vueltas, literally the River of Turns, which is quite aptly named, as you can see in the photo! You also get views of the valley below and the mountain chain. 

There are 106 metres of elevation gain on this trail, which at times feels a bit steep, but it's a short hike. 

6. Laguna Capri

Distance: Approximately 8 km round trip

Elevation: 424 metres

Duration: 2–3 hours

Difficulty: Easy to moderate

If you want epic views for relatively low effort, I would suggest the Laguna Capri hike. It leads you to a gorgeous azure lake with Mount Fitz Roy standing proud in the background. It's something straight out of a postcard. I remember feeling it should require more effort to earn such epic views!

This is a very doable hike for those with limited time or seeking a less strenuous option. The trail is around 8 kilometres round-trip and takes 2 to 3 hours to complete. 

The Laguna Capri trail shares its initial stretch with the Laguna de los Tres hike. In fact, the day we hiked to Laguna de los Tres, we had only planned to go as far as Laguna Capri! However, we arrived relatively early and were feeling strong, so we decided to continue on. But had we not, the plan was to spend the day lakeside and soak in the views.

This is also a great picnic spot; we had already eaten most of our lunch by the time we got here, but it's a great place to linger.

I would say this is an excellent hike for families, beginner hikers, or even those acclimatizing for longer treks.

7. Glaciar Huemul

Distance: Approximately 3 km round trip

Elevation: 211 metres

Duration: 1.5–2 hours

Difficulty: Easy

Hiking to Glaciar Huemul requires renting a car or arranging some form of transportation since this trail is an hour's drive north of El Chaltén. The trailhead is near the Lago del Desierto Campground on the south shore of the lake.

The hike to Glaciar Huemul is a short 3 kilometres round-trip that takes just 1.5 to 2 hours. The trail offers views of Lago del Desierto, Cordón del Bosque, the north face of Cerro Chaltén, and the Río de las Vueltas Valley.

The trail winds uphill through a private reserve and features mossy forest, wooden bridges, and crystal-clear streams. Though it’s a short hike, the ascent is steady and can be slippery after rain. 

At the top, hikers are rewarded with a spectacular view of the hanging Huemul Glacier spilling down a cliff face into a turquoise lagoon below. 

This is a great half-day adventure if you're after glacier views without the effort of a full-day trek.

8. Laguna Azul

Distance: 5 km round trip

Elevation gain: 80-100 m

Duration: 2 hours

Difficulty: Easy

Laguna Azul translates to 'Blue Lagoon' and it's an easy trek that starts 17 kilometres north of El Chalten. 

Tucked within the private reserve of Estancia Los Huemules, the trail to Laguna Azul offers a peaceful contrast to the busier routes inside Los Glaciares National Park. 

The hike starts from the reserve’s visitor center and winds through lenga forest, crossing a footbridge over the Río Diablo before gaining some gentle elevation. 

Near the end, the path skirts a small waterfall and includes a final creek crossing before arriving at a crystal-clear lagoon framed by forest and rugged hills. 

If you wish to press on, a short ridge walk beyond Laguna Azul leads to Laguna Verde, offering views of Fitz Roy’s north face peeking behind Cerro Eléctrico. 

Because Laguna Azul sits in a private reserve, the hike requires an entrance fee. Last season, the price was 28,000 ARS ($20 USD) per person, but you can check their current rates on their website. On the bright side, you can tackle 5 different hikes within the nature reserve.

Moderate Hikes in El Chaltén

These intermediate trails are longer and involve more elevation gain, but remain accessible to most fit hikers. They can be done as half-day or full-day trips. You can easily squeeze a couple of these into your itinerary, even if you only have 3 days in El Chalten.

9. El Paredón

Distance: 3.7 kilometres

Elevation: 299 metres

Duration: 1.5 hours

Difficulty: Moderate

If you want to enjoy views of El Chalten without the crowds, I think the trek to El Paredón is a wonderful alternative. The name El Paredón literally translates to 'the wall', referring to the massive rock wall that overlooks the Las Vueltas River.

In fact, during our first day in El Chaltén, my husband and I noticed that there were loads of rock climbers going up the paredón. We did the Costanera walk along the riverside just so that we could watch them in action! However, it's also possible to go up.

The trail starts on the east end of town as soon as you cross the bridge over the Las Vueltas River. The trail then immediately heads south along the river's edge and slowly winds north again as you begin the ascent to the top of the rock wall. 

While this is considered a moderate hike in terms of difficulty, it does get steeper the further you go, with the final ascent being the steepest. It's a mostly dirt trail and is slippery in some sections, so expect a bit of scrambling. 

The reward is the view of the town below, the Las Vueltas River, and the peaks of Fitz Roy off in the horizon. The El Paredón hike is a nice option to catch sunrise or sunset. Just be prepared for it to be windy up there!

Consider this a warm-up hike for some of the bigger treks in El Chalten.

10. Cerro Torre

Distance: 17.5 km round trip

Elevation: 571 metres

Duration: 6–8 hours

Difficulty: Moderate

The hike to Cerro Torre is one of those classic treks in El Chaltén that you can’t skip. It's also known as the Laguna Torre hike since it brings you to the lagoon at the base of the mountain.

Cerro Torre is actually the tallest in a chain of four that also includes Torre Egger, Punta Herron, and Cerro Standhardt. Pretty epic lineup, right?

The full hike is about 17.5 kilometres round trip. Most people take around 6 to 7 hours to do it, but of course, it depends on how fast you walk and what the trail is like that day (parts can get pretty muddy). Difficulty-wise, it’s considered moderately challenging.

The trail kicks off through a gorgeous valley, and along the way, you’ll spot some waterfalls. The steepest part of the climb happens right at the start, but once you get to around kilometre 3.5, things flatten out, which makes it easier to find a rhythm and cover more ground at a steady pace.

One of the things that kept us going on this trail was the fact that we could see Torre Glacier in the distance - it felt like the glacier was cheering us on. Plus, the route kept things interesting: we wandered through forests, along a river, and the scenery was always changing.

The big reward came at the end when we reached the viewpoint over Laguna Torre, a glacial lake sitting right at the base of Cerro Torre. Sometimes there are little icebergs floating around, and with that mountain backdrop, it’s a dream spot for photos.

The only bummer for us was that by the time we got there, clouds had rolled in and covered Cerro Torre, so we missed that postcard-perfect view.

If you’ve still got some energy once you hit Laguna Torre, you can keep going a bit further to Mirador Maestri. From there, you get even better views of the Torre Glacier.

11. Loma del Pliegue Tumbado

Distance: Approximately 20 km round trip

Elevation: 1132 metres

Duration: 7–9 hours

Difficulty: Moderate to challenging

If you’re looking for a hike in El Chaltén that’s a bit less crowded than the super popular ones like Laguna de los Tres or Laguna Torre, then Loma del Pliegue Tumbado is a solid choice.

The trail starts right at the Visitor Center (same spot as Mirador de Los Cóndores and Mirador de Las Águilas), but instead of going left, you’ll see a marker pointing you to the right.

The path takes you through patches of forest, and then you come out onto this wide-open flat area called Pampa de las Carretas. From there, the climb continues, and you eventually hike past the timberline.

The last stretch is definitely the toughest; it’s steep, you gain elevation fast, and there are switchbacks with loose rock that keep you on your toes. But honestly, the views at the top make all of it worth it.

At the summit, you get this jaw-dropping 360-degree panorama of the whole area: Mount Fitz Roy, Cerro Torre, Lake Viedma, Cerro Huemul, and even the Río Túnel Valley. 

Of course, those views are earned via an elevation gain of nearly 1,000 meters. The big joke with this hike is that “The only time you don’t go up is when you go down!” You've been warned.

12. Piedra del Fraile

Distance: 14 km round-trip

Elevation: 262 metres

Time: 4–5 hours

Difficulty: Moderate

The hike to Piedra Frail is one of those that requires transportation. It starts 17 kilometres outside of El Chalten; the trailhead is at the Río Eléctrico bridge on Provincial Route 41. That means you'll need to rent a car, arrange a taxi or join a guided hiking tour that provides transportation. 

The hike gets its name from the piedra or boulder that was dumped in the valley by the glacier. The trail starts off in an open area, goes through shrubbery, and then enters the lenga forest, but it always stays close to the Electric River.

Piedra del Fraile has a small campsite and refuge that acts as the first overnight stop for hikers who are tackling bigger hikes to Pollone Lagoon, the Marconi Glacier or the Paso del Cuadrado. Keep in mind that these are more challenging hikes that require special equipment and more technical experience, so you'll want to consult with the National Parks Administration before heading out.

13. Piedras Blancas

Difficulty: Moderate

Elevation gain: 230–300 metres

Distance: 13.2 km (there are variants depending on route)

Time: 3.5 to 4 hours round-trip 

The Piedras Blancas trail, often called Mirador Piedras Blancas or Glaciar Piedras Blancas Viewpoint, is a quieter glacier-view alternative to the main Fitz Roy treks. 

Starting from the bridge over the Río Blanco (near El Pilar / Route 41), the route first passes through forests and follows the river corridor before rising gently toward a viewpoint overlooking the Piedras Blancas Glacier. 

Along the way, you pass through lenga woods, cross into Los Glaciares National Park, and enjoy views of Cerro Eléctrico and parts of the Fitz Roy massif. 

Because this trail branches off and intersects with parts of the Laguna de los Tres route, many hikers integrate it as a side excursion rather than a standalone hike. 

The glacier itself sits around 2,000 metres away from the viewpoint, and you may see icefalls and glacier ice movement on clear days.

Difficult Hikes in El Chaltén

These challenging hikes involve long distances, steep ascents, and more technical terrain. Perfect for seasoned trekkers seeking Patagonia’s most iconic vistas.

14. Laguna de los Tres

Distance: Approximately 22 km round trip

Elevation: 1053 metres

Duration: 8–10 hours

Difficulty: Challenging

The hike to Laguna de los Tres is hands down one of the most spectacular day treks in El Chaltén, and it honestly lives up to the hype. This was the first big hike that we tackled on our visit, and we started out with a bang!

The name actually means “Lagoon of the Three,” and it’s a nod to those three peaks: Fitz Roy (3,405 m), Poincenot (3,002 m), and Saint-Exupéry (2,558 m). 

Now, just a heads up: this isn’t a casual stroll, so you’re looking at a full-on trekking day. Most people take 8 to 10 hours, depending on pace and fitness. It’s definitely a challenging one, not only because of the distance, but also because the final kilometres culminate in a steep and strenuous ascent that climbs 400 meters.

Trekking poles? Highly recommended.

I’ll be honest, during that final kilometre, I seriously considered turning around. I was so tired, and the climb ahead seemed unending. It was the encouragement from hikers coming down telling us, “Don’t give up, it’s so worth it!” that kept us going.

Once we finally made it over the ridge, I understood what they meant. You’re rewarded with this stunning glacial lagoon framed by a glacier and massive granite peaks. The lagoon was this perfect deep blue, the glacier snaked down the mountain, and clouds drifted dramatically over Mount Fitz Roy and the surrounding peaks. It was one of those jaw-dropping moments where all the pain of the trek just melted away.

Sam and I huddled behind a big boulder to escape the wind, pulled out what was left of our packed lunch, and just sat there soaking in the view until it was time to face the steep descent and long walk back to El Chaltén.

I’ll be honest, Laguna de los Tres isn’t for everyone; it’s demanding and long, but if you’re up for the challenge, the payoff is unforgettable. It's one of the best Patagonia hikes for the views alone!

Multi-day Hikes in El Chalten

15. Huemul Circuit

Distance: 65 km loop

Elevation: 2,838 metres

Time: 4 days

Difficulty: Very Difficult

If you're a hardcore hiker and you're looking to challenge yourself in El Chalten with a multi-day trek, then consider the Huemul Circuit.

Let me be very clear, this trip is NOT for beginners! The route involves river crossings, unpredictably windy mountain passes, a scree field, an ever-changing glacier and even two Tyrolean traverses. Not only do you need adequate gear, but you also need the experience to navigate the demanding terrain.

The rewards are the views of the South Patagonian Ice Field, the world's third-largest ice field (after those in Antarctica and Greenland) and aside from getting on a helicopter, this is the only way to see it!

The Huemules trek is typically completed in 4 days and 3 nights. However, it's important to keep in mind that this is a weather-dependent trek that can and will get cancelled if the winds are deemed too strong - this is especially important on days 2 and 3.

I would recommend reading this detailed first-hand account of the trek so you know what to expect.

Updated: Hiking Fees in El Chaltén

NOTE: As of October 2024, Los Glaciares National Park, which encompasses most of the popular hiking trails out of El Chaltén, has introduced a mandatory entrance fee (view current rates here). 

If you visited El Chaltén when hiking was free, like I did, you may be in for a bit of a surprise on your return visit. New fees have been introduced, and these are supposed to fund trail maintenance and conservation efforts, helping ensure the region stays pristine for future visitors. However, the prices are a bit steep!

Note that these are the rates for foreign visitors, which are listed as 'general admission'. If you are a national visitor or a provincial resident of Santa Cruz, the fees are much lower.

1‑day pass - 45,000 ARS ($45 USD) 

3‑day pass - 90,000 ARS ($90 USD)

7‑day pass - 157,500 ARS ($157 USD)

These passes can be purchased online in advance or at one of the entry gates near trailheads around El Chaltén.

Note that not all trails require fees. For instance, hikes outside the park remain free of charge. However, most people come to El Chaltén to tackle the famous trails! 

Some travellers also report they can avoid paying by starting hikes before 7 a.m. or after 6 p.m., when control booths at the trailheads are unstaffed, though this shouldn’t be relied on as a strategy.

Final Tips for Hiking in El Chaltén

Hit the trails early.

Start early for the best light, fewer crowds, and increased wildlife sightings. Many of El Chaltén’s hikes are most beautiful at sunrise or early morning, when the peaks of Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre glow orange and pink. Starting early not only improves your chances of seeing wildlife like condors or foxes but also helps you avoid strong afternoon winds and trail congestion.

Most trails start in town.

All hikes start in or near town, so you can base yourself in one spot without needing transport. One of the great advantages of El Chaltén is its compact layout; once you get to town, nearly all major trailheads are accessible on foot. This means you can stay in a central hotel and still walk to every hike, no car or shuttle needed. That is, unless you're tackling some hikes outside the park or in private nature reserves.

Check the weather before each hike. 

The weather in Patagonia is famously unpredictable and can change quite rapidly. Clear skies in the morning can turn into rain, wind, or snow within hours. Always check the day’s forecast at your accommodation or the visitor center before setting out.

Use Windguru to see the wind forecast.

Strong winds are a defining feature of the region, especially in the afternoon. Local hikers and guides use Windguru to get detailed wind forecasts. It's a great tool to know if your hike will be breezy or a battle. We also found this website super helpful when booking our day excursions in El Calafate, especially our glacier boat tour, because we wanted good weather that day!

Pack the essentials in your day pack.

Bring layers, sunscreen, snacks, and water for every hike - even the short ones. Weather conditions can change dramatically throughout the day, so dress in layers and pack essentials like a windbreaker, gloves, and sun protection. Even on short hikes, it's best to be prepared.

Camping is allowed in designated sites.

If you're planning to do multi-day hikes, there are designated backcountry campsites such as Campamento Poincenot and Campamento De Agostini. These sites have basic amenities and are first-come, first-served. Bring your own gear and follow Leave No Trace principles.

Rent gear in El Chaltén.

Don’t worry if you didn’t pack trekking poles or a tent. El Chaltén has several outdoor outfitters where you can rent everything from sleeping bags to camp stoves.

Build in recovery days.

If you're building an itinerary, mix a few easy day hikes for recovery days with one or two major treks like Laguna de los Tres or Laguna Torre. We could not move after tackling our first 20+ kilometre hike; we needed a full day to sleep, stretch and hobble around! Other people like to treat themselves to a fancy dome stay as a reward for completing all their hikes. The choice is yours.

Don't bypass El Calafate

Once you're done trekking in El Chalten, be sure to spend a few days in El Calafate. This town sits on the south end of Los Glaciares National Park, and this section of the park has a series of trails and boardwalks where you can see glaciers and icebergs, the most famous of them all being the Perito Moreno Glacier. It's a completely different experience! You can find my complete El Calafate travel guide to help you plan your visit.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,a9654ae350d4819557b67de93cfbf17e647d0e1d

This passenger train travels over 800 kilometres from the city of Bariloche at the foot of the Andes Mountains to the city of Viedma which sits near the Atlantic Ocean.

It takes 18+ hours to complete the full journey which coincidentally also crosses the Province of Río Negro.

Travelling aboard the Tren Patagónico is a great way to experience the magic of the Patagonian steppe and see a side of northern Patagonia beyond lakes and snowcapped mountains.

Plus, it's an opportunity to see local wildlife; namely, hares, guanacos and lots of sheep!

In this blog post, we're going to share how you too can travel aboard the Tren Patagónico and what to expect from the train journey.

FAQ's about the Tren Patagónico

Is there a train through Patagonia?

The Tren Patagónico crosses northern Patagonia from east to west, connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Andes Mountains.

There is currently no train that travels the length of Patagonia from north to south, though there are short tourist train segments for sightseeing purposes.

How much does the Tren Patagónico cost?

At the time of publication, the cost to travel from Bariloche to Viedma is $4,800 ARS. (So $23 USD at the official rate or $12 USD at the Blue Rate).

Where does the Tren Patagónico go?

The Tren Patagónico is a passenger train that travels from the city of Bariloche at the foot of the Andes to the city of Viedma on the Atlantic Ocean.

The Tren Patagónico makes stops in Bariloche, Pilcaniyeu, Comallo, Clemente Onelli, Ingeniero Jacobacci, Maquinchao, Los Menucos, Sierra Colorada, Ministro Ramos Mexia, Nahuel Niyeu, Valcheta, San Antonio Oeste, Winter, Palacios, and Viedma.

How long is the Tren Patagónico train journey?

The Tren Patagónico is an 18+ hour overnight train journey. You board the train in the late afternoon/early evening and arrive the following day around noon.

If you're looking for a fun way to get to Bariloche or Viedma (depending on the direction you're travelling), this train is it!

What days does the Tren Patagónico travel?

The Tren Patagónico typically travels from Viedma to Bariloche on Fridays, departing Viedma at 18:00 and arriving in Bariloche at 12:28 the following day.

It then runs from Bariloche to Viedma on Sundays, departing Bariloche at 17:00 and arriving in Viedma at 11:34 the following day.

That being said, it is always best to check the official website for an updated schedule before you plan your trip, and know that train delays are quite possible.

Is the Tren Patagónico the same as the Old Patagonian Express? 

No, the Tren Patagónico and the Old Patagonian Express, also known as La Trochita, are not the same train.

The name Tren Patagónico translates to 'Patagonian Train' but is not to be confused with the Old Patagonian Express - these are two very different journeys in different provinces!

The Old Patagonian Express is a tourist train in the Province of Chubut that you can ride as a half-day excursion.

Meanwhile, the Tren Patagónico is an overnight journey that crosses the whole Province of Río Negro from the mountains to the sea.

How to book the Tren Patagónico

There are a few different ways to book a journey aboard this train.

Online

The first option is to try booking your train tickets online on the Tren Patagonico official website.

The only thing is that the website is entirely in Spanish, so you'll need some language skills.

The other issue is that sometimes the website doesn't show availability even though there are tickets available!

It's not the most straightforward option, but if you want to try it, click the 'Venta de Pasajes Online' button on their website and go from there.

At the train station

The other option is to go in person to the train station. The Tren Patagónico website shows you can book tickets at the train stations in Viedma, San Antonio Oeste, Ingeniero Jacobacci, and San Carlos de Bariloche.

The hours of operation for the train stations differ and some only open on certain days or for a few hours a day, so check the schedule on the official website before you make the trek over.

Via a tour operator

The best option, I would say, is to book your tickets via a tour operator. You can do so in a few select cities:

In Bariloche: Bioceánica Turismo, Mooving Travel, Gerardo de los Cerros, Surface Travel, Huiliches Turismo, Natural Travel, and Vivir Viajes

In El Bolsón: Grado 42

In Las Grutas: Ocasión Turismo

In Viedma: Monatour, Araucarias, Kosten, and Free Time

This is probably the easiest and most stress-free option. Let someone else take care of the details and just hand you tickets!

Travelling Aboard the Tren Patagónico

Since we travelled from Bariloche to Viedma, our train departed at 17:00 and we were asked to be at the station one hour prior at 16:00.

There were 3 classes to choose from when booking our train tickets: First, Pullman and Camarote.

First is actually the cheapest class, Pullman is the in between option, and Camarote is the one with private cabins.

We travelled in the Pullman carriage which featured reclining seats, a fair bit of legroom, and heat or AC (depending on the time of year).

Another thing to note about this train is that it has a movie carriage that’s available to passengers in Pullman and Camarote, and it also has a disco carriage for those who want to dance the night away as the train chugs across the Patagonian steppe.

I have to say, I loved the scenery on this train journey! We got to witness a magical sunset over the Patagonian steppe paired with ever-changing views. The fields were washed in gold with the last rays of day, and it was spectacular.

Shortly after departing the station in Bariloche, an attendant went across the carriage asking each passenger their final destination - that way they know where to stop and potentially wake you up if you’re getting off in the middle of the night.

Then another attendant came by selling snacks, so we got some milanesa sandwiches, and we also confirmed our reservation in the dining carriage.

The earliest time they had available was 21:00, which is a typical dinner time in Argentina. We ended up sharing a table with an Argentine couple and stayed up until 02:00!

We snoozed for four hours and then it was time to get off at our stop. We sleepily disembarked in San Antonio Oeste so that we could continue onwards to the seaside resort of Las Grutas.

And that was our experience travelling aboard the Tren Patagónico from the mountains to the sea!

#1 Pick

Ushuaia City Tour Aboard a Double Decker Bus

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars 

⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 1 hour 10 minutes

The Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour is a 1-hour sightseeing tour aboard a blue vintage bus. It provides a brief introduction to the southernmost city in the world and takes passengers to various attractions beyond the tourist trail.

What is the Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour?

Before we dive in, let's be very clear about what this bus tour is not. 

The Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour is NOT a hop-on hop-off bus tour where you can get off at your chosen attraction, spend some time exploring, and then wait for the next bus to come by a few minutes later to pick you up. 

This bus tour is a city sightseeing tour where you drive around the city and see a lot of places in passing. 

During the tour, you get to listen to a narrated audio guide which offers commentary on Ushuaia's history and the attractions you're seeing along the way. 

You only disembark at two points throughout the tour for brief photo ops. 

Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour

All aboard the Ushuaia City Tour Bus

The Ushuaia city bus tour departs from Civic Plaza Ushuaia on the corner of Avenida Maipú and Comodoro Augusto Laserre Sur. This is right downtown just one block north of the port, so it's super easy to find.

Look for the old-fashioned London-style double-decker bus painted bright blue, and then get ready to be transported back through time once you step aboard. 

During this bus tour, you’ll get to learn about Ushuaia’s history and hear fun anecdotes, with a bit of tango music in between.

The entire trip is narrated by an audio guide. You'll get a set of headphones and be able to choose from 8 different languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian and Chinese.

Attractions on Ushuaia Double Decker Tour

So what will you see during the tour?

Well, as I mentioned earlier, most of the attractions you will visit (or mainly drive by since this tour is just over an hour!), are not super touristy. 

Here's the official bus route so you know what to expect:

Old Government House: Originally constructed in 1893, the building underwent a transformation after a devastating fire in 1920, resulting in its current design. The Old Government House is now also an annex of the End of the World Museum.

First School: The first school in Ushuaia was established in 1890, called Escuela Nº 1 Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. 

First Church: In 1898, Ushuaia's first church was built, a catholic church called La Iglesia Parroquial de Ushuaia, which is now a National Historic Monument. 

Otero House: This is the historic home of Lucinda Otero, a renowned writer who depicted life in Ushuaia through her poetry. 

Malvinas Monument: This is a war memorial with a wall of remembrance that contains the names of the 649 Argentine servicemen who were killed in the war for Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) in 1982.

First Graveyard: Ushuaia's first cemetery takes up half a block just north of Plaza San Martin and it's where many of the early settlers are buried. 

CADIC: This stands for Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas or Austral Center for Scientific Research. It's the southernmost interdisciplinary research centre, not counting the bases in Antarctica.

University: Tierra del Fuego National University or Universidad Nacional de Tierra Del Fuego is the university at the end of the world. It offers multiple careers in environmental science, political science, economy and education. 

Monte Gallinero: This area is home to a battery with Bofors M45 DP 105mm cannons. 

Monte Vigia: Another historic hill near Monte Gallinero.

Pipo River: This is where the Pipo River crosses through the city of Ushuaia.

New Neighbourhood: As the name suggests, these are the new neighbourhoods under development where you'll see a lot of new constructions. 

Prisoners' Path: This is a historic hiking trail in the city's west end where you can still see the remains of the train track sleepers that took the prisoners from the prison to the forest.

Devil's Lagoon: This is a small green lagoon that's part of a nature reserve. It's named so because back in the day animals used to disappear during the winter months (unfortunately falling through the ice!) and local lore was that the devil was taking these animals. 

Buena Esperanza: Not super exciting but this is the local water treatment plant. 

Italian Neighbourhood: A historic neighbourhood where a lot of Italian families initially lived. 

Hospital: Another exciting attraction, I know, but you'll get to go by the local hospital. 

Saint Christopher: Formerly known as the HMS Justice where she served as a rescue tug in the Royal Navy, the Saint Christopher is a vessel that was later chartered for salvage operations in the Beagle Channel. After suffering engine trouble and rudder damage, she was beached and abandoned in the harbour, where she's now a tourist attraction. 

End of the World Museum: This museum focuses on local history and natural history, and has exhibits dedicated to sailing, whaling and seabirds.

Navy Harbour: With some luck you might get to see part of the naval fleet docked in the port.

Fournier Monument: Monument to remember the ARA Fournier, a minesweeper of the Argentine Navy that was in service from 1940 until her sinking in 1949.

After reading this list, you probably have a better understanding of what I meant by less touristy attractions in Ushuaia. I mean, schools, hospitals, local neighbourhoods and the local water treatment plant probably aren't on your list of places you plan to visit in the southernmost city, but it gives you an overview of the city from a more local angle. 

You also go past the Old Government House, the Malvinas Monument, the Saint Christopher beached on the city shores, so there are some spots geared more towards tourists. 

There are two stops along this tour where you actually get off the bus. The first one is the Devil's Lagoon where you can snap some photos and enjoy the greenery. 

The next stop is in front of Aeroclub Ushuaia. This isn't even listed as an official stop on the itinerary, but it offers great panoramic views of Ushuaia. So if you're looking for those postcard shots of the city, this is where you get them.

My Experience on the Ushuaia Bus Tour

Let me say, I had very few expectations from this bus tour because I kind of booked it on a whim. 

I figured it would be a good tour to do early on in my trip to Ushuaia so I could get a lay of the land and perhaps revisit some places if something caught my eye during this brief bus tour. 

This sightseeing bus allowed me to see places in Ushuaia I otherwise never would have made it to, not only because they were too far for a tourist to get around on foot, but also because we visited less touristy places that weren't exactly on my travel radar. 

With so many of Ushuaia's main attractions concentrated along the port or in the historic centre, it was nice to see where the locals live and what the city outskirts look like. 

I also enjoyed the audio guide since it provided context to what we were seeing. Otherwise, the attractions wouldn't have made a lot of sense since we were only seeing them in passing. 

As for my initial idea of retracing my steps to places of interest, I have to say, nothing I saw during the bus tour really warranted a longer visit.

We had enough time at the two scenic stops of the trip, the Devil's Lagoon and the Ushuaia Aeroclub, that I didn't feel the need to go back anywhere with more time.

There's so much to see and do in Ushuaia - go on a Beagle Channel cruise, ride the Train at the End of the World, visit the Ushuaia Prison Museum - that I'm glad I only spent an hour touring the city and therefore had plenty of time to enjoy other activities.

Alternatives to the Ushuaia Bus Tour

If the Ushuaia Double Decker bus tour doesn't sound like your cup of tea, you may be interested in checking out the Ushuaia City Train. 

This train is NOT the End of the World Train, but rather a city sightseeing train that does a similar loop through Ushuaia. 

The Ushuaia City Train is a 1-hour journey (slightly shorter than the bus by just 10 minutes) and it covers 13 kilometres (2 kilometres less than the bus). 

You also get 2 photo stops along the way, though at different locations. 

You can check out the Ushuaia City Train Tour here. 

Is the Ushuaia Double Decker Bus Tour worth it?

I would say it depends on the type of traveller you are and what you want out of your trip. 

If you enjoy visiting quirky spots and you want an off-the-beaten-path look at Ushuaia, then this bus tour delivers. Also, it runs just over an hour, so it's a good way to see the city quickly especially if you're on a short trip to Ushuaia. 

You'll get to see the city beyond the historic centre, you'll drive through local neighbourhoods, and you'll get to learn about the city's history via the audio guide. 

It's also an activity to consider during the cooler months in Ushuaia when you may not feel like spending a lot of time exploring the city on foot.

On the other hand, if you're super pressed for time and you have a long list of activities in Ushuaia that you really want to get through, then you should probably focus on those.

Perhaps your time would be better spent hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park, cruising the Beagle Channel, enjoying a helicopter flight over Ushuaia, or so many other things!

I'm glad I did the tour because I got a good overview of the city and I feel like I know Ushuaia beyond its tourist sights, however, I don't think it's a must. But ultimately, the choice is yours!

Estancia El Ombú de Areco runs an estancia day and gaucho tour program where you can spend the whole day at a countryside ranch horseback riding, enjoying an Argentine barbecue, and learning about gaucho culture and traditions.

We recently spent a few days in San Antonio de Areco, the town known as the cradle of gaucho culture, which is where Estancia El Ombú de Areco is located and it was one of the highlights of our visit!

This day tour to Estancia El Ombu de Areco is a best-seller! It includes transportation to and from Buenos Aires, a town tour of San Antonio de Areco with a guide, horseback riding, a traditional Argentine BBQ, live folklore music and dancing, and a gaucho horse-whispering demonstration. This tour has over 800+ reviews and 5 stars. 

Visiting Estancia El Ombú de Areco

While there are many things to do in San Antonio de Areco, the activity we were most looking forward to was an estancia day trip where we could enjoy the countryside and learn more about the gaucho culture. 

We spent several days in the town of San Antonio de Areco (we even stayed at an estancia just a short walk from the centre of town!), however, on our last day we decided to visit the most famous estancia around: El Ombú de Areco.

Estancia El Ombú de Areco is located on the outskirts of town and it is a working estancia that has also been welcoming guests since 1993. 

Their Día de Campo or 'Countryside Day' program is one of the more popular tour offerings in the area. It's a full day gaucho tour where you spend the day at the estancia and it's also a fun day trip from Buenos Aires.

Since we were already in the area, we booked this gaucho day tour directly through the estancia and organized our own transportation there, however, if you're coming from the city, you can book this estancia day tour from Buenos Aires which includes your transportation there and back plus a visit to several landmarks in the town of San Antonio de Areco. 

Now without further ado, I'm going to tell you all about our estancia day at El Ombú de Areco so you know exactly what to expect!

A brief history of the estancia

As soon as we arrived at Estancia El Ombú de Areco, we were greeted by a member of the staff who shared a brief history; we learned the estancia dates back to 1880 and that it's been in the hands of the Boelcke Family since 1934. 

The estancia stretches out over 300 hectares, which are divided between grazing cattle and agricultural land. They have 350 heads of Aberdeen Angus livestock, and their fields are planted with soy, corn, wheat and oats depending on the time of year.

As for the name, Estancia El Ombú de Areco is named after the ombú tree, which we were surprised to learn isn't even a tree!

This tree-like plant is actually a type of bush that grows in the pampas and requires very little water to thrive. 

If you knock on the trunk, it sounds hollow, and the branches are quite soft and spongy to the touch. This makes the ombu capable of storing water within itself, which protects it from both droughts and wildfires that can occur in the plains. 

And can we take a moment to appreciate the size of the ombú and the amount of shade it provides? This is why gauchos revere it. 

Welcome drinks and empanadas

After that fascinating introduction to Estancia El Ombú de Areco, we were offered a welcome snack: an empanada and a beverage of our choice.

If you're new to Argentina, an empanada is a savoury pastry that can have numerous fillings, however, the classic is ground beef. 

It can be baked or fried (in my opinion, fried is best as it enhances the flavours!) and it can be served as an appetizer or as a meal.

I'm happy to report that the empanadas at the estancia were fried, juicy and absolutely delicious. We each had two, but I could've honestly devoured half a dozen.

We were also offered drinks and were able to choose from wine, beer, soda, water or juice. 

Horseback riding or a carriage ride

Once we had a snack in our bellies, it was time for the first activity: a choice between a horseback ride or a carriage ride. 

We've done a lot of horseback riding in Argentina (our most ambitious expedition was crossing Cordoba's Sierras Chicas on horseback!), so this time around, we opted for a carriage ride since it's something we hadn't done before. 

The carriage is locally known as a sulky or carruaje and it's a small lightweight cart pulled by a single horse. 

Our carriage ride was enjoyable but brief. Those who opted to go horseback riding enjoyed an in-depth tour of the estancia grounds, however, we'd had a lot of rain just before our visit, which explains why we couldn't venture too far with the carriage. Keep that in mind when making your selection!

Traditional Argentine BBQ lunch 

Next up, it was time for lunch! Part of the estancia day experience is that you get to enjoy a traditional Argentine BBQ, locally known as an asado.

Sam and I went investigating and asked to visit the parrilla where they were grilling the meat. 

The traditional way of grilling in Argentina is by making a wood fire to one side and then taking the coals as they form and sliding those underneath the grill. 

The lunch setting was beautiful - the high ceilings, the colonial floor tiles, the balcony and columns covered in ivy. The tables were set up all along the terrace for al fresco dining, so we still had protection in case of rain.

Every table had a bottle of Malbec wine, and the grilled meat was the star of the meal. We got to try chorizo, morcilla, and various cuts of beef, chicken and pork.

This was accompanied by multiple salads and side dishes, including a tomato, lettuce and cucumber salad; a carrot, corn and egg salad; and potatoes au gratin.

The food was abundant! The waiters kept walking by with trays of meat, offering us new cuts fresh off the grill to the point where we had to decline.

For dessert, we opted for flan with dulce de leche, a classic Argentine dessert. It was the perfect way to end a feast of a meal!

Note: The estancia can accommodate vegetarians, vegans and celiacs, however, you must let them know of your food restrictions at the time of your booking. 

Live folklore music and dancing

I should mention that halfway through lunch, musicians set up on the terrace and we got to enjoy live folklore music or música gaucha.

This paved the way nicely because, by the time we were done with dessert, we were invited to come and learn one of the traditional folklore dances.

At this point, most tables had already consumed their bottle of wine, so everyone was feeling extra jovial and uninhibited - in fact, not a single guest declined dancing!

Having spent part of my childhood in Argentina, the music and dances brought back lots of memories since we used to learn these at school and perform them for special dates and assemblies, so it was fun to relive the experience. 

Doma India or horse whispering

Then, it was time for the doma india or horse whispering. The bond between a gaucho and his horse is truly something special and this is one of the things you get to witness on this estancia day tour from Buenos Aires.

The true gaucho's approach to taming a horse is a gentle one built on trust. 

""Around 1600, the Indigenous people of Argentina discovered horses and soon created their own method to tame them, completely void of outside influence. They demonstrated an uncanny ability to gently train their horses which surprised the Conquistadores, who underestimated them and in general treated them with contempt.""
History of Indian Dressage via Areco Tradition

During the demonstration, we got to see how a gaucho calmed his horse and moved him into various positions without any force or struggle. The horse lay down on its side, then on its back, and also put its legs up in the air.

We all sat in a semi-circle and watched as the horse melted from one position to the next, following the gaucho's guidance.

It's important to be very quiet during the doma india to not startle the horse. We were asked not to make any noise, sudden movements or even use the flash on our cameras.

Free time at the estancia

If you're visiting the estancia on a day tour, this is probably where your tour ends. However, because we had booked directly through the estancia, we still had a bit more time to enjoy the grounds.

For those visiting during the summer months, bring your bathing suit and a towel because the estancia lets you make use of their swimming pool. You'll likely be craving a dip during a hot summer's day in the pampas!

We visited a bit later in the season, so it wasn't swimming weather, but we still had lots of different activities to keep us busy. The estancia has soccer fields, volleyball courts, pool tables, ping pong tables, mini foosball, sun loungers and more.

We befriended the estancia dogs, then plopped ourselves on a lounger in the shade and enjoyed an afternoon siesta. 

An afternoon snack and farewell 

Finally, it was time for merienda which is a light afternoon meal. I can't say we were the least bit hungry after the copious lunch we had, however, that didn't stop us from accepting a small dessert. 

We opted for lemon squares and a beverage out on the lounge chairs. 

It was a nice way to end our day at the estancia and bid San Antonio de Areco farewell before travelling back to Buenos Aires. 

Booking your tour to El Ombú de Areco

As I mentioned earlier, because we were already staying in San Antonio de Areco, we booked this estancia day and gaucho tour directly through El Ombú de Areco. We arranged everything via WhatsApp (this is commonly done in Argentina) but alternatively, you can send them an email via their contact form.

Because we booked directly, this does mean we were responsible for arranging our own transportation to and from the estancia. As a heads up, half of the drive is on paved roads and the second half is on dirt roads. 

We booked a taxi and arranged a time for drop off and pick up. However, because it had rained quite heavily for days leading up to our visit, the dirt roads were intransitable. The estancia coordinated a meeting point where the pavement ends and then they sent one of their own drivers in a pickup truck that would be able to handle the mud.

If you're booking the estancia day tour from Buenos Aires, you won't need to worry about transportation since hotel pick-up and drop-off are included.

Final thoughts on the gaucho tour

We loved this gaucho day tour! The staff at Estancia El Ombú de Areco are super attentive and thoughtful.

We've done a lot of estancia day tours (like this one in El Calafate) and overnight estancia stays across Argentina and I can honestly say this one was a notch above the rest. 

The Día de Campo itinerary had a good pace; there were plenty of activities to fill the day but it wasn't so much that we were exhausted at the end of it all. 

The combination of horseback riding or carriage rides, a leisurely BBQ meal on the terrace, live folklore music and dancing, and the gaucho horse demonstration were just perfect. 

At the end of the day, we got to experience a wonderful day in the countryside, learn about gaucho culture and traditions, and it was a nice change of scenery from Buenos Aires. 

There's a reason why this tour has 5 stars and over 800 reviews, so I would highly recommend it!",CheArgentinaTravel.com,9697c447ee31885b66e3f8d941aa59c526a3aaa4

Located in the Andes mountains in the majestic Province of Chubut, Los Alerces National Park is made up of a chain of interconnected rivers and lakes that weave their way through ancient forests.

Highlights include a boat ride on waters that shift from emerald to turquoise, seeing glaciers hanging from the mountain tops, and coming face to face with the second-longest living tree species in the world - the alerce which earns the park its name!

Los Alerces National Park was declared a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site in 2017 in order to protect the most extensive forest of alerce trees in Argentina.

Los Alerces National Park is the kind of place that takes your breath away with its natural beauty, and it's definitely worth a spot on your northern Patagonia travel itinerary.

This full-day tour to Los Alerces National Park from Esquel visits the cave paintings, the Interpretation Museum, Puerto Limonao, Irigoyen Waterfall, and many other picturesque spots along the way.

Getting to Los Alerces National Park

By car

If you want to explore Los Alerces National Park at your own pace, the best way to do so is by renting a car. This can be done in Esquel, which is the biggest town in proximity to the park.

You'll want to take Ruta Nacional 259 and then turn right on Ruta Provincial 71 to continue heading north towards the park.

From Esquel, it is 30 minutes until you reach the boundaries of the park, however, you'll have to drive 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach the centre of the park (the area around Pasarela Rio Arrayanes), which is the starting point for many tours and activities.

By bus

You can also take a bus from Esquel to Los Alerces National Park. However, since we were visiting during low season, there was only one daily bus with Transportes Esquel leaving in the early morning and returning in the evening. 

We made sure to arrive at the bus terminal 1 hour ahead of departure to make sure we could get seats on the bus since you can’t reserve tickets ahead of time and once they’re gone, they’re gone.

It's also imperative that you buy return tickets so that the bus driver will save you a seat on the journey back. There were some people who only paid for a one-way fare, and then the bus was full on the way back! The only options were to hitchhike, try to get a taxi, or spend the night.

Tours to Los Alerces National Park

A guided tour is a great way to experience Los Alerces National Park and thankfully there are plenty of options to choose from depending on your interests.

Los Alerces Half-Day Tour - This is a 4-hour tour where you visit some of the park highlights like Villa Futalaufquen, the Interpretive Museum, cave paintings, Puerto Limonao and Irigoyen Waterfall.

Los Alerces Full-Day Tour - This is a 9-hour tour where you do all of the above, plus you drive to another section of the park to see the Arrayanes River, Menendez River, the Solitary Lahuan, Puerto Chucao and more.

Bosque de Alerces Milenarios with Glaxiar - This is a boat tour of Lake Menendez followed by a hike to see the ancient alerce trees - it's the tour we did!

Trek to Torrecillas Glacier with Glaxiar - This is a hike through the forest to the base of the glacier (this is the only tour operator that offers this excursion).

Kayaking in Los Alerces with Kayak Soul - This tour operator offers day excursions within the park as well as longer kayaking expeditions.

The thing to keep in mind is that certain tours may offer transportation from Esquel, while others require that you make your own way to the park. So make sure you know how you're getting there before you book your excursion!

Our visit to Los Alerces National Park

Out of all the excursions available at Los Alerces National Park, we opted for the one that included a boat ride on Lake Menendez followed by a hike to visit the oldest-known alerce tree in the park, so that's the experience we will be sharing.

Hike to Puerto Chucao

Since the particular tour we chose didn't include a transfer, we asked our bus driver to drop us off at Pasarela Rio Arrayanes. From this point, we had a 20-minute walk ahead of us to reach Puerto Chucao where our tour was departing from.

The walk was beautiful! First, we went over a suspension bridge that crosses the Arrayanes River, where we got to see the most incredible gem-coloured waters that went from teal to turquoise to emerald.

It was such a scenic walk, the kind that tempts you to stop for a photo every ten steps, but we had to keep the pace in order to make it to the starting point of our tour.

We eventually reached Puerto Chucao (with time to spare!), and this is where we met our guide and boarded the boat.

Boat tour of Lake Menéndez

Much like the walk over to the port, the scenery on the boat tour was incredible! There were forested mountains everywhere we looked and we even got to see the Torrecillas Glacier (you can trek up to the glacier but that's a different excursion offered by Glaxiar).

We had ideal weather that day so we were able to go out on the boat's top deck and enjoy the views.

We cruised the full length of Lake Menendez soaking in the views until we reached the tip of the north arm. The journey was about an hour and a half in length, and then we disembarked in Puerto Sagrario for the next part of the tour: hiking to the millenary alerce trees!

Seeing millenary alerce trees

The main draw to Los Alerces National Park is the alerce forest which sits in a protected area that can only be accessed by authorized boat tours.

The alerce tree is known as lahuán meaning 'grandfather' in the Mapuche language, or Fitzroya cupressoides.

It grows in the Valdivian temperate rain forests below the higher elevations of the Andes in both Argentina and Chile.

These trees can grow from sea level up to 1,500 meters above sea level, and though they are slow-growth trees, they can reach heights of 40-60 meters though some 70-metre trees have also been documented.

An interesting fact about the alerce tree is that it only grows between 0.6 to 1.6 millimetres per year, so they are able to tell a tree's age based on its width.

These trees are one of the longest living species in the world; in this park, you have one that is 2,700 years old and over in Chile there are some over 3,600 years old.

From the port, we embarked on a 2.2-kilometre hike with an elevation gain of 70 metres over the course of the walk.

The hike was a mix of forest trails and boardwalks with some steps in the sections with more uneven terrain. It was a loop, so we ended at the same spot where we began - in front of the Grandfather Alerce.

We then returned back to Puerto Chucao. We still had two and a half hours before we needed to catch our bus, so we set out to explore a bit more of the park.

We hiked to Lago Verde on our way to the meeting point where we waited for our bus back to Esquel!

Is visiting Los Alerces worth it?

Yes, 100%!

This was one of our favourite day trips from Esquel, and in fact, we enjoyed the park so much that we have since revisited it on other trips to Patagonia.

This park can also be accessed from the north end via El Bolsón, so we've seen quite a bit of the park since our first visit.

That being said, this excursion combining a boat tour of Lake Menendez and a hike to see the millenary trees remains our favourite way to experience the park.

It's one of the must-see places in Patagonia and well worth the journey.

The ancient alerce forest cannot be reached on foot, so this tour is the only way to see them up close. Plus since the group size is limited, it feels a lot more intimate.

Once you board the boat it's just you and your small group and it feels like you have the whole Valdivian forest to yourself!

So if you find yourself travelling in northern Patagonia, yes, make time for Parque Nacional Los Alerces. You won't be disappointed.

And if you're sticking around Esquel for a few days, don't miss out on trips to the Welsh town of Trevelin, a train ride aboard the Old Patagonian Express, the strange standing rock at Piedra Parada, Butch Cassidy's ranch in Cholila and the small towns and villages of the Comarca Andina.

31176baa96cadefd2fbbf7db6117d36539df93b8,che_argentina_travel,en,Visiting the End of the World Post Office in Ushuaia,"Sending mail from the End of the World Post Office was something I knew I wanted to do during my visit to Ushuaia!

Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world and it really relishes its status. It's right here at the very bottom of Patagonia that you'll also find the post office at the End of the World, ride the train at the End of the World, and tour the prison at the End of the World.

Talk about ticking off bucket list items!

In this blog post, we're going to focus on how you can visit the End of the World Post Office, send some postcards, and get your passport stamped with an End of the World stamp.

Because if you're making it all the way to the bottom of the Earth, you may as well relish the achievement!

Where is the End of the World Post Office?

The post office at the end of the world is located in Tierra del Fuego National Park in Ushuaia, Argentina.

It's only an 11-kilometre drive from the city of Ushuaia to the park's entrance and there are a variety of ways to get there.

You can catch a shuttle from the Ushuaia Bus Terminal, you can take a taxi, or you can visit the park as part of a guided tour.

Once you reach the park and have paid your admission fee, you follow the main road (Ruta 3), and then turn left on the dirt road that leads to the trailhead for Senda Costera, or the Coastal Path.

Right at the edge of the water on Bahía Ensenada Zaratiegui is where you'll find the End of the World Post Office!

If you have the time, you can spend the whole day in the park and hike after visiting the post office. That's exactly what we did but more on that later!

If you're pressed for time, this half-day tour to Tierra del Fuego National Park might be a good idea. This 4-5 hour tour includes a visit to the southernmost post office for a stamp, a quick hike to Lago Roca, and a visit to Bahía Lapataia where the Panamerican Highway ends.

Sending mail from the End of the World

Made of corrugated metal and wood, this tiny post office sits atop a pier on the shores of the Beagle Channel and it’s the last chance to send mail before reaching Antarctica.

The post office at the end of the world is super cozy with a wood-burning stove, an all-wood interior and a skylight.

The exterior is plastered in stickers from travellers who’ve reached this place from all over the globe, and inside the walls are covered in postcards, maps, magnets and currencies from faraway lands.

There can be long lines at the post office at the End of the World if you happen to be there at the same time as a tour bus. In that case, there will usually be a long line that stretches out of the post office, but it does move fairly quickly.

To give you an idea of prices for mailing a postcard, we paid the equivalent of $4.40 USD for international postage and we were told it would take around 20 days for the postcard to arrive.

And yes, it did make it all the way to Canada!

Where can I get a passport stamped in Ushuaia?

Aside from sending mail, you can also get your passport stamped at the post office at the end of the world.

Getting your passport stamped costs the equivalent of $2.50 USD in pesos, and you get a collection of stamps that fill one passport page.

During my visit, I was given a sticker commemorating Carlos de Lorenzo, the postman at the end of the world, whose post office was at one point located on Isla Redonda 2 kilometres from shore.

Next was a double stamp featuring a penguin next to a postbox which read 'Correo del Fin del Mundo Ushuaia, Argentina' which translates to 'Post Office at the End of the World Ushuaia, Argentina'. There was a little penguin wearing a scarf and a hat next to that one.

There was another stamp that read 'Argentina' with a small Argentine flag next to it.

And lastly, a stamp with the date of my visit.

But fret not if you can't reach the Post Office at the End of the World during your stay in Ushuaia, because there are two more ways to get your passport stamped!

You can go to the Tourist Office in Ushuaia just east of the pier where boat excursions depart from, or you can also get a stamp during your Beagle Channel cruise (crew members come around with a stamp and anybody who wants one can get one).

Hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park

After visiting the End of the World Post Office, sending postcards and getting our stamps, we decided to spend the rest of the day hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park. I mean, we were already there!

We hiked the Senda Costera, which is the coastal trail that starts at Bahía Ensenada Zaratiegui directly west of the post office.

This trail hugs the coastline and runs past numerous coves and beaches, with plenty of opportunities for bird watching along the way.

We'd recommend packing a picnic because there are lots of nice places to stop along the way!

It takes anywhere between 3-4 hours to hike the Senda Costera and it's considered medium-level difficulty.

The trail ends in Alakush, which is where the Visitor's Centre is located and inside there's a cafeteria where you can celebrate completing the hike with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake!

This is also where the shuttle back to Ushuaia departs from, so it's the ideal place to end your hike.

And that's our guide to visiting the End of the World Post Office in Ushuaia. Now you know how to get there, how to send mail, how to get a stamp, and where to hike.

That takes care of one full day of your Ushuaia travel itinerary! You can get more ideas of fun tours in Ushuaia and find some handy travel tips here.

Taking a Perito Moreno Glacier tour is a must-do activity for anyone visiting El Calafate! This is one of the few advancing glaciers in the world and it is a behemoth that is fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third-largest reserve of fresh water on Earth.

The Perito Moreno Glacier is located in Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina's Santa Cruz Province, and it's one of the most important tourist attractions in all of Patagonia. The national park itself is a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognizing its exceptional natural beauty and importance.

The glacier itself covers an area of 250 km², is 30 kilometres long, and the ice reaches a depth of up to 170 meters. It is one of 48 glaciers that are fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field!

The magnitude of this glacier is hard to put into words, but it moved me to tears and I count standing in front of the glacier as one of the highlights of my travels across Patagonia. 

In fact, I enjoyed my experience seeing Perito Moreno Glacier by boat so much, that I went back to Los Glaciares National Park a second time to see the glacier again from a different perspective.

The thing about visiting Perito Moreno Glacier is that you can experience it in so many different ways and it's almost a little hard to choose because each option is more epic than the last! You can see the glacier by boat, by kayak, on an ice trek or from the boardwalks and balconies in the national park. 

Experiencing the glacier is one of the best things to do in El Calafate and we're going to help you choose the best Perito Moreno Glacier tour for you. Let's get started!

Best Perito Moreno Glacier Tour

1. Boat Tour to the Glaciers

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10-12 hours | ✅ Book it!

I'm starting off with my personal favourite: a full-day boat tour of the glaciers in Los Glaciares National Park. 

The beauty of this tour is that you not only visit the Perito Moreno Glacier, but also the other glaciers in the park. This is something that can only be done by boat, as you need to cruise the waters of Lago Argentino to reach the other glaciers.

During this glaciers boat tour, we got to see Spegazzini Glacier, which rises 135 meters above sea level; Upsala Glacier, which measures 53 kilometres in length; and, of course, Perito Moreno Glacier, which is the most famous glacier in Argentina. Just to name a few!

Other highlights included seeing glacial waterfalls cascading down the mountains, fishing chunks of icebergs from the lake (for drinks), and disembarking at Puesto de las Vacas for a guided hike. 

We had beautiful weather with sunshine and blue skies, so we spent most of the day out on the deck ohh-ing and ahh-ing at the landscapes around us and relishing the icy air every time we got close to a glacier.

This tour is called Glaciers Gourmet and you travel aboard Maria Turquesa. We opted for the basic option, which includes a packed gourmet lunch box, however, you can also choose the premium tasting menu, which is a more high-end experience that also gives you access to a private deck.

This excursion was our big splurge of the trip, but we were so happy to do it! It exceeded our expectations.

2. Perito Moreno Mini Trekking on Glacier

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10 hours | ✅ Book it!

This next Perito Moreno Glacier tour is the most adventure-filled way to experience the glacier. I mean, you can't get any closer than actually walking on the glacier itself!

This tour includes transportation, so you'll be picked up from your hotel and make your way to Los Glaciares National Park. Once you reach the park, you'll have 1 hour to explore the Pasarelas - these are the boardwalks and balconies that offer beautiful views of Perito Moreno Glacier. This is your chance to snap some photos!

This glacier trekking tour also includes a 20-minute boat ride because in order to reach the glacier, you first need to cross the Rico Arm. There's a small dock area at Bajo de las Sombras where this crossing takes place. 

Once you reach the other side, you'll have a briefing session with a professional ice trekking guide who will explain how things work on the tour - that means no deviating from the path the guide sets and everyone walks in a single file. 

You'll gear up with helmets, crampons and ice axes, and then the fun begins. You'll embark on a guided 3-hour trek first along the coast, next moraine, then on the glacier itself, and finally through the woods. 

The level of difficulty is considered moderate; the glacier's surface is irregular but safe and firm.

The glacier trek is a unique way to explore Perito Moreno's blue-hued crevasses and seracs. So if you’re looking for a bit of adventure, this activity certainly ticks the boxes!

Glacier treks are an expensive item, and that's because there's only one tour operator for this activity in El Calafate, and a limited number of people can participate each day. Tours are divided into a maximum of 20 people per group and there is 1 guide for every 10 participants.

You can probably get this tour for a bit cheaper if you book locally once you arrive, however, keep in mind that this tour can also sell out days in advance during high season, so if you want to organize it locally, do so as soon as you get into town!

3. Perito Moreno Glacier Kayaking Tour

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 10 hours | ✅ Book it!

Another unforgettable way to experience Perito Moreno Glacier is on a kayaking tour. I bet you didn't think that was possible!

The nice thing about this tour is that aside from kayaking, you also get 2 hours to enjoy Los Glaciares National Park. You can use this time to walk the boardwalks and balconies for incredible views of the Perito Moreno Glacier. 

Since you are kayaking on glacial waters, there's a bit of prep work that goes into this tour. For starters, you'll have to wear a Gore-Tex dry suit, a thermal suit, boots, gloves and a life jacket.

After selecting your suits and getting dressed, we'll head to the shores of Lago Argentino for a safety briefing - you can't get too close to the glacier since calving events occur quite frequently!

You'll then do some warm-up exercises and enter the water at Playa de los Témpanos or Iceberg Beach. From this point, you'll begin paddling towards Perito Moreno Glacier.

The maximum distance you can approach the glacier is 600 meters, and this is because when a chunk of the glacier breaks off, it produces a large wave. But we're talking about a glacier that stands over 60 meters tall from the water line, so this is a case of objects appearing a lot larger even if they're not that near.

The actual kayaking time is 1 hour and 30 minutes. This Perito Moreno Glacier tour is a great option for travellers who want an active experience. 

PROS:

Kayak in front of Perito Moreno Glacier

Time to walk the boardwalks and balconies

Includes snacks and lunch

""This day was incredible, and the glacier exploration was one of the best things we did on our trip to Argentina. The staff was communicative before and during our trip, and made special arrangements for our hotel pickup. Then, all the details like the drive into Parque Nacional Los Glaciers, the lunch and the timing were done well. And the actual adventure kayaking to the glacier was fun and stunning. We had more than enough time to explore the glacier walkways afterward as well. Perfect day."" -Geremy B (Read more reviews)

4. Perito Moreno Glacier including Navigation

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 8 hours | ✅ Book it!

I would say this is the classic day trip to Perito Moreno Glacier, where you get to experience the park from two perspectives: first exploring the park on foot and then boarding a vessel that brings you closer to the glacier.

The boardwalks and balconies offer panoramic views of the glacier, and if you stick around long enough, there's a good chance you'll get to witness a calving event - this is when large pieces of the glacier break off and fall into the water, causing a thunderous roar that echoes across the park. The subsequent waves that form are nothing short of impressive.

Aside from the boardwalks, you can also enjoy hiking some of the forest trails or visiting the Iceberg Lagoon. 

This is followed by a 1-hour boat journey so you can appreciate the intricate details of the glacier from a bit closer. This is a nice alternative to the full-day boat tour, if you don't want to commit to a long journey.

This tour to Perito Moreno Glacier provides ample time in the park, so you won't feel rushed, and it means you can cover all the park highlights.

PROS:

See the glacier from the boardwalks

1-hour boat trip to the glacier

Full-day tour

""We were very lucky with the weather, not a cloud in the sky, just blue and sunny all day. Julieta was a great guide explaining everything in Spanish and in English for the travellers on the comfortable bus. The first sight of the majestic glacier as we went round a curve was exciting. The boat ride up close to the glacier was marvellous, so were the pasarelas. The national park is well kept and preserved as it should be, a lot to learn from Argentina and Chile Patagonia parks. It was the hightlight of our visit to Argentina. Thanks to Cristian, the driver also."" -Jane Marylin P (Read more reviews)

5. Footbridges of Perito Moreno Glacier Tour

⭐️ RATING: 5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 7-8 hours | ✅ Book it!

This Perito Moreno Glacier tour option is essentially transportation to and from Los Glaciares National Park with free time to explore as you please. 

You'll be picked up from your hotel (or a pre-defined meeting point if you're staying in an AirBnB or private apartment) and you'll then drive out to the park, which is a 1.5-hour journey. 

Pick-up in El Calafate is at 10:30 and you can expect to be back in the city around 5:00 pm. Always confirm the schedule on your booking as these times could be subject to change. 

This gives you plenty of time to walk the boardwalks, balconies and trails. Plus, you can visit Laguna del los Témpanos or Iceberg Lagoon - this is where the chunks of ice that break off Perito Moreno Glacier end up!

If you get hungry over the course of the day, you can visit Nativos de la Patagonia, the only restaurant inside the park. It has beautiful views of the glacier, and you can choose between a la carte or buffet dining. 

This is the most budget-friendly way to visit Perito Moreno Glacier, plus it gives you a lot of independence once you're in the park. 

PROS:

Transportation to the national park

Free time to explore the boardwalks and trails

A budget-friendly way to see Perito Moreno Glacier

""On time pick up and the guide gave a lot of information during the bus ride. Free to explore the glacier walkways at your own pace. Smooth trip back. Would recommend for an easy way to visit. Thanks!"" -Ckmalita (Read more reviews)

Admission fee to Los Glaciares National Park 

It's important to note that most of these day tours do not include the admission fee to Los Glaciares National Park in their tour price.

This is because the admission fee varies depending on whether you're an in-province tourist, out-of-province tourist, or out-of-country tourist. 

The park fee for foreign visitors as of 2024 is $12000 ARS, which at the time of writing is just under $15 USD per person. You can view the most up-to-date rates here.

The Los Glaciares National Park website also says that they accept payment by Visa, Mastercard, debit card or cash. My tip is to bring cash!

As someone who has travelled across Argentina extensively, I can tell you first-hand that it's very common for the internet connection to be down in these remote areas, which means payments can get processed! This is something that has happened to me on more than one occasion.

The bus transporting you to your Perito Moreno Glacier tour will stop at the park entrance so you can pay your admission fee. 

If you choose a tour that doesn't include transportation, you can read about how to get to Perito Moreno Glacier here.

You can view the trails and boardwalks in Los Glaciares National Park's south sector here on AllTrails.

The Best Tango Shows in Buenos Aires

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by La ventana Tango (@laventanatango.ba)

1. La Ventana Tango Show

Best tango and folklore show

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

La Ventana Barrio de Tango is one of the more popular tango shows in Buenos Aires. The tango venue is set in a former conventillo, also known as a tenement, so it's a historic establishment that has been renovated to have an old-time feel with vaulted brick ceilings and stained glass windows.

Meanwhile, the stage has been set up to look like an old street in Buenos Aires from the turn of the 19th century.

This is one of my favourite tango shows in Buenos Aires, probably because it's the first one I ever went to, so I have very fond memories of it. I took my British friend to this show, and we even signed up to do a tango lesson before the performance.

Another cool thing about this particular tango show is that you'll get to see both tango and folklore on the stage, which I think is a nice introduction to Argentine gaucho culture, particularly if you're not planning to leave the city.

When it comes to booking this experience, you can opt for just the show or the dinner and show. The dinner is a 3-course meal featuring an entree, main dish and dessert.

""La Ventana Tango Show is a must-see for anyone looking to experience tango with a mix of folklore. The dancers were nothing short of phenomenal and the music performed live by an exceptional band enhanced the experience. The service was attentive and the atmosphere made it a memorable night out. We left with a deeper appreciation for the art form and a strong desire to return. Highly recommended!"" -Paul

2. El Viejo Almacén Tango Show

Best traditional tango show

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 1.5 hours | ✅ Book it!

El Viejo Almacén is a tango show set in San Telmo, a bohemian neighbourhood that's worth exploring for its outdoor markets, street art and lively atmosphere.

The show is set in a historic venue that dates back to 1769. Over the centuries, this building has housed a field warehouse, a British hospital, and a general customs office before becoming a 'Temple of Tango' in 1969.

El Viejo Almacén is a popular tango show that runs 365 days a year. This makes it a good option for some last-minute plans in the city.

This is a two-story venue where guests can sit on either the main floor or the balcony that overlooks the room. The tango show features an orchestral quintet and four dance couples gracing the stage.

They offer a show-only option, dinner and show, or VIP dinner and show, which includes an open bar once the tango performance starts at the tanguería.

""As a solo traveler, this was recommended by multiple locas as one of the best shows in town, smaller more personal with more history than the other shows. Amazed with the performance, truly recommend it. The transfer from the hotel right on the dot."" -Luis

3. El Aljibe Tango Show

Best early tango show

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

One thing you need to know about tango shows in Buenos Aires is that they are generally a late-night affair. 

Dinner is eaten quite late in this country (most restaurants in Argentina don't even open for dinner until 8:00 pm!), so that means tango shows also tend to run quite late.

This can make it a little tricky for foreigners who have just arrived in Buenos Aires and are feeling a bit jet-lagged or simply don't want to be out super late. However, this particular tango show's early start is an exception, and I think that makes it a nice option for visitors or even families who want to attend a show with children.

At El Aljibe, dinner is served at 7:00 pm and the tango show begins at 8:15 pm. They also offer an option that includes a tango lesson starting at 6:00 pm if you book directly through them. 

The venue, El Aljibe, is located in Buenos Aires' historic Monserrat neighbourhood, so it's a very central location and easy to access.

""Fabulous show and food! This is a must. This was the first thing we did in Buenos Aires and it did not disappoint. The show is so much fun and shows different forms of dance. So entertaining. The service was top notch and very accommodating. And this was our first steak in Argentina and was outstanding. You will love this."" -Allyson

4. Tango Porteño Show

Best tango show on stage

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

Tango Porteño puts on a tango show in a theatre just across the street from the famous Teatro Colón and one block up from the Obelisk. If you've walked down Avenida 9 de Julio, you've likely seen the theatre as it's hard to miss, especially when it's all lit up at night!

The venue is an art deco building that once housed the famous Cine Metro owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

While some of the smaller venues only host tango shows a few times a week, because this is a large and centrally located theatre, it has shows every night of the week.

Tango Porteño covers various time frames starting with tango's origins along the Río de la Plata and following its evolution into a contemporary dance. 

The show will transport you to Argentina's golden age of tango, featuring 25 artists and a live orchestra.

""The Tango Show was outstanding and the dinner was fantastic!! The band was also phenomenal. The entire group enjoyed the show."" -Warren

5. Rojo Tango Show

Best cabaret-style tango show

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 hours | ✅ Book it!

Rojo Tango Show is a cabaret-style tango performance that takes place at Hotel Faena, a luxury 5-star property in Buenos Aires' Puerto Madero neighbourhood.

The venue has a strong 1920s vibe featuring red lighting, red velvet and gold trim. It is a small, dimly lit setting with a decidedly intimate feel where the dancers and live band feel within arms reach.

Guests are served a contemporary Argentinean 3-course meal with an entree, main dish and dessert, as well as champagne and wine.

Dinner is served at 8:30 pm, and the show begins at 10:00 pm.

This cabaret tango show is best suited to travellers looking for a small venue with an intimate feel and it's a high-end experience with a price tag to match.

""This was fabulous from start to finish. Enrique (driver) picked me up at my AirBNB right on time. He was the most gracious, classy escort to the beyond beautiful Hotel Faena. The hotel is stunning. The venue is small and intimate. I had a front table which was great. The dancers were within arms reach. The servers are so attentive and the food was outstanding. They all spoke English and every need was met. The show is wonderful. The dancers are amazing , singers and band were top notch. I would highly recommend and would go again if I were here longer. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Worth every penny. Bring cash for tipping and the staff and driver are worth a big tip. Enrique was waiting for me to deliver me back. Got back around midnight."" -Mary Elizabeth

6. Cafe de Los Angelitos Tango Show

Best tango show set in a historic cafe

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3 hours | ✅ Book it!

Cafe de Los Angelitos is a historic cafe and a beautiful venue located just two blocks west of the National Argentine Congress. I know we're talking about tango at the moment, but it's a really nice place to go for breakfast or have an afternoon coffee with a pastry.

Though Cafe de Los Angelitos is best known as a cafe, it's also a place where you can watch a tango performance. The venue dates back to 1890 and it's a place that was frequented by Carlos Gardel, one of Argentina's most famous figures in tango. In fact, Gardel signed his first contract at this very cafe!

This place also has the distinction of being the first cafe to put on a tango show back in 1940.

You have a few different options when it comes to seating during the tango show, including in the main dining room, the VIP balconies, or the intimate super VIP section on the second floor.

You can customize the type of experience you'd like to have: tango show and drinks, tango show and dinner, tango show and dinner with your own private table, or the tango show and VIP dinner option. 

The nice thing about the tango performance at Cafe de Los Angelitos is that it's done on a smaller scale, so it feels a bit more intimate rather than a big stage production.

""Fantastic from start to finish. Driver picked us up at the hotel on time and was waiting at the end of the show. Food was excellent and the show itself was outstanding. Would definitely recommend."" -Lisa

7. Esquina Homero Manzi Tango Show

Best tango show with a neighbourhood feel

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 1.5-3 hours | ✅ Book it!

Esquina Homero Manzi is another tango show that I have personally attended in Buenos Aires - I brought my in-laws here the very first time they visited Argentina. 

This tango venue is located in the Boedo neighbourhood, and it has more of a local feel. There's a famous tango titled 'Boedo' about this traditional working-class barrio, which was quite influential in the Buenos Aires tango scene.

The tango show is named after Homero Nicolás Manzione Prestera, an Argentine lyricist of many famous tangos and milongas, some of which were recorded by the one and only Carlos Gardel. 

The show at Esquina Homero Manzi is all about reliving the 1940s. This was considered the golden age of tango with orchestras, singers, and composers shaping the musical styles that endure to this day. 

Guests have the option of choosing between show only, show and dinner, or show and VIP dinner. We opted for the dinner and show option and were quite pleased with the abundance of wine and the meal. 

""The club is very nostalgic, looks like something from a movie. Singing, musical numbers and dancing. We enjoyed wine and split a salad. Starts around 10 pm and lasts 80 minutes."" -Lis

8. Teatro Astor Piazzolla Tango Show

Best tango show with a contemporary flair

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 3.5 hours | ✅ Book it!

This Buenos Aires tango show takes place in Teatro Astor Piazzolla, a belle epoque theatre located inside Galeria General Güemes.

The tango show is named after Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine tango composer and bandoneon player who revolutionized the traditional Argentina tango and created a new style called nuevo tango incorporating jazz and classical music elements.

The Astor Piazzolla tango show pays homage to Piazzolla and features many of his songs.

Visitors can choose between the tango show only, tango show and dinner, or tango show and VIP dinner where the meal is served in the theatre balcony.

The nice thing about the tango show at Teatro Astor Piazzolla is its super central location along Calle Florida. They offer transfers to the venue, but if you're staying in the area, you can also easily get there by walking and take in some of the sights while you're at it. 

""Fabulous evening and fantastic value. As soon as we arrived we were invited to tango class included in the price of our ticket. The teachers were great and we had a wonderful time. Dinner was lovely. We both ordered the chicken dish which looked like a creation from a fine Parisian restaurant. Very delicious and paired well with the white Malbec that was surprisingly good and flowing freely! The actual show was truly fantastic. We loved the combination of an authentic band eon orchestra, singers and of course amazing tango dancing that included tango from the 20's 40's and modern day. A five start experience!"" -Stephen

9. El Querandi Tango Show

Best tango show with a historical element

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

El Querandi is an award-winning tango show set in a restored mansion that dates back to the 1920s. 

What makes El Querandi one of the best tango shows in Buenos Aires is that it covers the history of tango throughout the performance. 

The show is divided into five eras: tango's origins, the role of immigrants and the working class neighbourhoods, the influence of Carlos Gardel, salons and milongas, and Piazzolla's modern take on tango. 

They offer a three-course a la carte menu that features traditional Argentine dishes. Plus, they can accommodate vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free meal requests with prior notice. The tango show at El Querandi also includes free drinks all night long.

Each reservation gets its own table, meaning you have a bit more privacy as you're not sharing the space with fellow guests.

""An incredible way to spend a night! Easy with the bus pick up, a delicious dinner, and the music, dancers, and ambiance were exactly what I was hoping for!"" -Amy

10. Señor Tango Show

Best Broadway-style tango production

⭐️ RATING: 4.5/5 Stars | ⏳ TOUR LENGTH: 4 hours | ✅ Book it!

Señor Tango is a large-scale tango production set in a theatre known as the 'Cathedral of Tango'. 

The venue is located in the neighbourhood of Barracas on the boundary between the city of Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires Province, but transportation is provided which makes getting there easy.

The show at Señor Tango takes place on a round stage in the middle of the theatre. It's a full-on spectacle featuring aerial performers, horses, and singers as well as couples gracing the stage to dance tango. 

If you're looking for a flashy performance that seeks to outdo itself, then Señor Tango fits the bill! There's a reason this is considered the biggest show in town.

Señor Tango is also a show that has drawn many celebrities and personalities, which only adds to its fame. 

""Great seats…overlooking the circular stage…and the tango was great! Especially the aerial stuff! And singers were great…and the horses! That was a real surprise! It was a huge production that worked like clockwork! It was a much grander extravaganza than the other tango show I went to. Definitely go to this one! It’s the best!"" -Dawn

Tango Shows vs Milongas: What’s the Difference?

If you’re visiting Buenos Aires and planning to experience tango, you’ll quickly come across two very different types of events: tango shows and milongas. Both are integral to the city’s cultural identity, but they offer distinct experiences depending on what you’re looking for. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide whether to choose one, the other, or ideally, both.

What Is a Tango Show?

A classic tango show is a choreographed stage performance designed to showcase the art of tango in a theatrical setting. Think of it as a night at the theatre, but with sensual dancing, dramatic lighting, elegant costumes, and often live orchestras or singers. These shows are typically held in venues that cater to visitors—such as historic theatres, cabarets, and elegant salons. They aim to impress through spectacle and precision.

Choreographed routines: Professional dancers perform polished sequences that highlight the elegance, passion, and technical skill of tango.

Live music: Most shows feature live musicians playing traditional tango pieces by icons like Astor Piazzolla and Carlos Gardel.

Optional dinner: Many venues offer a three-course meal before the performance, often with Argentine classics like empanadas, steak, and Malbec wine.

Tourist-friendly: Announcements, service, and even brief narrations are often available in English, making these shows very accessible to first-time visitors.

Set schedule: Tango shows usually start in the evening, often between 8–10 p.m., and last 1.5–2.5 hours depending on whether dinner is included.

Best for: Travellers who want a polished, theatrical introduction to tango without needing any prior dance knowledge.

What Is a Milonga?

A milonga is something entirely different: it’s a social tango dance event where locals and visitors gather to dance together in a more spontaneous and communal setting. This is where tango lives and breathes in everyday Buenos Aires. Instead of sitting back and watching, at a milonga, you’re part of the atmosphere.

Social dancing: Rather than choreographed performances, couples of all levels (from beginners to lifelong tangueros!) fill the dance floor.

Authentic environment: Milongas are often held in neighbourhood clubs, cultural centers, or even outdoor plazas, giving you a real glimpse into local life.

Codes and traditions: Many milongas follow traditional “códigos” (dance floor etiquette), like the cabeceo, a subtle nod used to invite someone to dance.

Live or recorded music: Some milongas feature live orchestras, while others use classic tango recordings. The music is played in tandas (sets of songs), with breaks in between.

Later start times: Milongas typically begin very late and can continue into the early hours of the morning.

Best for: Travellers who want to immerse themselves in local tango culture, observe social dancing up close, or even join 

Tips for booking a tango show in Buenos Aires

Decide on the type of tango experience you want. As you've seen with the different tango shows we've highlighted, there's something for everyone. The tango experiences in Buenos Aires range from small, intimate shows to large stage productions. Plus, the performances can also vary from cabaret-style to classic shows that combine traditional tango with folklore and more contemporary dance elements.

Consider the tango show and dinner packages. Most tango venues offer a dinner and show or drinks and show package. I've always opted to book the dinner and show since I find it convenient and the food is typically quite good (expect a 3-course meal with at least one of the main dish options being steak!) If you don't want the dinner package, you can always choose to have dinner at a nearby restaurant or parrilla and then make your way over for the show. Just give yourself enough time (I'd say at least 2 hours) since service can be a bit slower in Argentina.

Prepare for a late night. As I mentioned earlier, most tango shows in Buenos Aires get going late with dancers hitting the stage around 10:00 pm, so you can expect to leave the venue close to midnight. The one exception is the early tango show at El Aljibe, which is geared at foreign visitors who aren't quite used to Argentina's late dining culture. This is a very convenient option, especially if you're dealing with jet lag!

Confirm transportation to and from the venue. Depending on where in the city you're staying, most tango shows will offer transportation to and from the tango show. However, if you're staying outside the city centre, you'll likely need to make your own way there, so consider your location when booking a tango show.

Book your tango show in advance. I would say a few days in advance is enough, especially if you want to attend one of the smaller shows where seating is limited. For the bigger stage productions, you can often get same-day tickets or at least tickets for the following day. I also like to book a bit in advance in order to confirm transportation details to and from the venue. This is an activity you can enjoy in Buenos Aires even in the rain.

Sign up for a tango dance lesson. Some of the tango shows highlighted on this list also offer a short tango lesson prior to the show. However, this is often something that needs to be booked directly through the venue as it's not typically included in the dinner and show packages. I took a tango lesson the very first time I went to a tango show in Buenos Aires, and while I didn't walk away with any real dancing skills, it did allow me to appreciate the intricacies of the dance on stage.

FAQs: Watching a Tango Show in Buenos Aires, Argentina

Is it worth seeing a tango show in Buenos Aires? Seeing a tango show in Buenos Aires is a quintessential experience. Tango originated in the impoverished port areas along the Río de la Plata, so it's an important part of the city's cultural heritage. Where can I watch tango in Buenos Aires? There are numerous tango and dinner shows in Buenos Aires and the majority of them are located in the neighbourhood of San Telmo. Some of the more popular shows include La Ventana, El Querandi and El Viejo Almacén. Where can I see tango on the street in Buenos Aires? There are several neighbourhoods where you can see tango dancing on the street in Buenos Aires. This typically occurs on weekends and in more touristy areas like Boca, San Telmo and even Puerto Madero. What to wear to a tango show in Buenos Aires? While you are not required to dress up for a tango show, most people dress smart casual. Dress pants or dark jeans with a collared shirt for men, and a dress or blouse with dress pants or a skirt for women, is appropriate. How long do tango shows typically last? Most tango shows run for 1.5 to 2.5 hours, depending on whether you book the dinner option. If dinner is included, you can expect to arrive 1–1.5 hours before the show begins. Non-dinner guests usually arrive closer to showtime. Can I attend a tango show without dinner? Yes, nearly all tango venues offer show-only tickets at a lower price. This is a great option if you prefer to dine elsewhere or want to save money. However, note that show-only guests are typically seated further from the stage than dinner guests. Are tango shows suitable for children? Most tango shows welcome families, though late start times (8–10 p.m.) may be challenging for younger kids. Some performances include more sensual choreography, so if you’re travelling with children, consider choosing a family-friendly venue and opting for earlier dinner seating. What’s the difference between a tango show and a milonga? A tango show is a choreographed stage performance featuring professional dancers, live music, and sometimes singers, aimed at visitors. A milonga is a social dance event where locals and tourists come together to dance; it's more authentic and participatory, but less theatrical. Some travellers enjoy doing both for a full tango experience.

Bariloche is a year-round destination and depending on the season you visit, there are a myriad of activities to enjoy.

I've had the opportunity to travel to Bariloche in spring, summer and autumn (winter is next!) and it's always a completely different experience.

Personally, autumn is my favourite time of year in Bariloche. I love hiking through the fall foliage, enjoying the crisp autumn days, and tucking into some hearty Patagonian dishes at a local restaurant. 

That being said, there are pros and cons to visiting in each season, meaning the best time to go to Bariloche depends entirely on the activities you're looking to enjoy.

Best Time to Visit Bariloche, Argentina 

Autumn in Bariloche 

March, April and May

Pros of Autumn in Bariloche

Autumn in Bariloche is my favourite time of year! I love it when the forest turns into a spectacle of reds, oranges, and yellows. It's the most picturesque time of the year and there are so many ways to soak in the scenery.

You can drive the Road of the Seven Lakes, go on a lakeside horse trek, or tackle some of the surrounding mountain peaks in Nahuel Huapi National Park.

One of my favourite autumn experiences in Bariloche is the hike to Laguna Verde via Refugio Neumeyer. The contrast between the red foliage and the green lagoon is pretty spectacular! This isn't a super popular trek, so I only discovered it thanks to joining a guided hiking tour.

Another pro of visiting Bariloche in autumn is that the weather is milder. Temperatures can range between 5–15°C (41–59°F), which I think is perfect for spending an active day outdoors.

This is also a good time of year to sample hearty Patagonian dishes like deer stew, lamb barbecue and lentil casserole. 

Another pro of autumn in Bariloche is that it's a quieter time of year. Kids have gone back to school, adults have gone back to work, and you get more affordable rates with fewer tourists.

Cons of Autumn in Bariloche

One of the cons of autumn in Bariloche is that once the peak summer season winds down, there are fewer tours and activities. It's not like the whole city shuts down because this is very much a year-round destination. However, tours are a bit more limited and run on a more restricted schedule since there is less demand. 

🍂 Trekking in the Andes Mountains - This private full-day hiking trip from Bariloche can be tailored to your interests and fitness level. It includes lunch and all necessary equipment.

Winter in Bariloche 

June, July and August

Pros of Winter in Bariloche

If you're looking for a dreamy winter wonderland with snow-covered mountains, winter is the time to visit Bariloche!

Winter is the peak season for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and a whole myriad of winter sports. The place to be is Cerro Catedral; this is the largest ski resort in the southern hemisphere with 32 lifts and 120 kilometres of slopes!

You may be surprised to hear you can enjoy winter treks in Bariloche. Some alpine refuges and trails close during the winter months, so if you're not too experienced in this region, it's best to trek with a local guide. They'll be able to navigate the terrain, keep a close eye on the weather, and provide you with snowshoes for sections of the trek where these are needed. 

If all of this is sounding a little too active, fret not! Winter in Bariloche can be a very relaxing experience if you choose to pamper yourself. If this sounds like you, I'd recommend booking a couple of nights at a luxury hotel with a spa and an indoor pool. Alternatively, you can opt for a cozy cabin with a wood-burning fireplace. Stay cozy indoors as you watch the snow come down!

Winter is also the perfect time of year to indulge in Bariloche's artisanal chocolate scene. There's something about the cooler weather that just makes you crave chocolate! The good news is that most chocolaterías have on-site cafes where you can indulge in hot chocolate, pastries and assorted chocolate boxes. 

If you need another reason to visit Bariloche in winter, consider attending Fiesta Nacional de la Nieve. The National Snow Festival features live music, wood-chopping competitions and ski races. 

Cons of Winter in Bariloche

So, winter in Bariloche sounds pretty dreamy. What are the cons?

The cold weather may deter some visitors. Temperatures range from -2–8°C (28–46°F), but if you wear thermal underwear and dress in warm layers, you'll be fine. I'm a firm believe that there is no bad weather, only inadequate clothing. Spoken like a true Canadian!

Another downside of winter in Bariloche is that ski resorts can become crowded, especially in July during the school holidays. This can drive up the cost of accommodations, so it's best to book well in advance. 

☃️ Private Winter Trek in Bariloche - This winter hike takes you through a snow-covered landscape and once the snow gets deep enough, it's time to put on some snowshoes! 

Spring in Bariloche 

September, October and November

Pros of Spring in Bariloche

There are many reasons to visit Bariloche in spring. For starters, the scenery is gorgeous! The surrounding forests and valleys come alive with vibrant greens and you also have wildflowers in bloom. 

Plus, temperatures are pleasant averaging 10–20°C (50–68°F), making it ideal for outdoor adventures.

Springtime is shoulder season, so you can enjoy the natural beauty and popular attractions without the heavy tourist influx. This is a good time of year to visit Isla Victoria, which will be in bloom with retamas - the flowering yellow bushes you see in the photos.

Another pro is that accommodation and tour costs are generally lower compared to peak seasons.

Cons of Spring in Bariloche

The cons of visiting Bariloche in springtime are that the weather can be a little bit erratic with sudden rain or even occasional late snow.

This can also be a windy time of year, especially in the months of October and November. You'll want to look at the weather forecast and plan your activities accordingly. 

Museums, coffee shops and breweries are fun activities for inclement weather days, and you can save your hiking for milder days.

🌿 Navigation to the Arrayanes Forest and Victoria Island - This boat trip will take you to the largest island on Lake Nahuel Huapi and you'll also visit a historic 300-year-old forest.

Summer in Bariloche

December, January and February

Pros of Summer in Bariloche

In many ways, summer is the ideal time to visit Bariloche. You have great weather and the days are long, which means you can make the most of your time outdoors. 

Daytime temperatures range from 20–30°C (68–86°F), which is great for exploring nature and even going for a dip in the chilly waters of Lake Nahuel Huapi, if you dare. FYI, this is Patagonia so the waters are frigid year-round, but summer is your best bet for a swim!

There are also loads of outdoor activities to enjoy like hiking, kayaking, horse trekking, mountain biking, zip-lining and fly fishing.

If you want to avoid the summer crowds, I would recommend activities that take you out of the city like a kayaking tour of Lago Moreno, a biking tour to Colonia Suiza via the back roads, or a horse trek through the Andes foothills. These experiences will bring you close to nature so you can soak in the essence of Patagonia. 

Bariloche is well known for its craft beer, so summer is a fun time of year to visit the different breweries and hang out on their patios. Lots of places serve beer flights so you can sample a few different brews. Raspberry beer is really popular in Patagonia and super refreshing on a hot summer's day!

Cons of Summer in Bariloche

Now let's talk about the cons. 

The main downfall of visiting Bariloche in summer is the crowds! This is one of the more accessible destinations in Patagonia (given the short flight time and flight frequency) and that makes it a popular spot. 

Our main struggle during our summer visit to Bariloche was traffic. We were staying at a cabin on the city outskirts and the lakeside road that leads to Circuito Chico and Llao Llao was often backed up. Whether you rent a car, use public transport or take taxis, getting places will take longer than usual.

Because summer in Bariloche is the peak tourist season, that also leads to busy trails, crowded attractions and higher accommodation costs. You may want to consider swapping the main attractions for lesser-known sites. 

☀️ Kayaking on Lake Moreno - This half-day kayaking excursion allows you to soak in the scenery, and it includes lakeside snacks.

And we've now covered the pros and cons of each season! As you can see, the best time to visit Bariloche greatly depends on the activities you want to do and whether you mind crowds.

But like I said at the beginning, Bariloche is a destination that can be enjoyed year-round. Whether you're looking for an action-packed itinerary or a few days of lakeside relaxation, you can find that here. So book that flight and come on down!

Each season here rewrites the script: spring wakes the vineyards with pastel blossoms and shoulder‑season bargains, summer turns the valley into a sun‑drenched playground of asados and outdoor sports, autumn steals the show with Vendimia harvest parades and vibrant foliage, while winter swaps pool days for ski runs and cozy barrel tastings by a crackling fire.

Think of Mendoza as a year‑round destination where you can choose your own adventure; the trick is matching your vibe and wardrobe to the calendar.

So grab a glass and let’s break down the pros, cons, and must‑see events for every season so you can time your trip like a local.

Spring in Mendoza

September, October and November

Pros of Spring in Mendoza

If you like the idea of vineyards waking up after their winter nap, spring in Mendoza is pure magic. The Andes Mountains are still sprinkled with snow, but down in the valley, the vines start pushing out bright green leaves and the orchards pop with blossoms.

Daytime temperatures hover around 20 °C (68 °F), making it perfect for patio lunches paired with a crisp Torrontés. Meanwhile, the evenings cool off just enough to justify a light jacket.

Vineyards and tasting rooms aren’t overcrowded and it's easier to book a tasting or a table for lunch at some of the more popular bodegas that tend to get fully booked during high season.

Spring is ideal for outdoor activities like rafting, horseback riding, and trekking in the foothills of the Andes - you’ll have miles of trails practically to yourself!

Another added benefit is that because tourism is moderate, shoulder‑season prices are still in play and you can often find better rates on hotels. You may even want to consider staying at a local estancia at the foot of the Andes.

Cons of Spring in Mendoza

The downside of spring in Mendoza is that the weather is a touch unpredictable! Occasionally, the infamous Zonda winds sweep down from the Andes bringing sudden heat and dust. 

Plus, there’s always a small chance of late frosts higher up in the Uco Valley. That being said, pack layers and you’ll be fine.

Summer in Mendoza 

December, January and February

Pros of Summer in Mendoza

Summer turns Mendoza into a sun‑soaked playground. Daytime highs sit in the low 30s °C (mid‑80s °F), grapes are ripening fast, and the vibe is festive.

Long summer evenings mean more opportunities for al fresco dining. The long, warm nights beg for an asado under fairy lights, and rooftop bars in the city centre buzz until late.

Outdoor adventures reach peak adrenaline: think white‑water rafting on the Río Mendoza, sunset paddleboard sessions on Potrerillos Lake, and high‑altitude hiking at the foot of Mount Aconcagua.

One Mendoza summer event not to be missed is Fiesta de la Cosecha, which rolls out a symphonic concert right in the middle of the 3 hectares of vineyards at El Plumerillo Airport. Picture violins, cellos, and Malbec under the stars!

Cons of Summer in Mendoza

The summer heat in Mendoza is both a friend and a foe. Expect plenty of sunny days and hot temperatures in January and February. While this is great for poolside relaxation and sampling crisp white wines, the mercury occasionally leaps toward 38 °C (100 °F), which can make midday winery tours feel like a sauna!

Bring sunscreen, a hat, and try to schedule your tastings for the morning or late afternoon. 

Tourism peaks during the summer holidays, leading to higher accommodation costs and busy wineries. Hotel rates and rental cars climb because local families are on vacation and travellers arrive en masse. 

So, if you can handle the heat, the higher prices, and the crowds, summer rewards you with full‑throttle energy and late‑night fun.

Autumn in Mendoza

March, April and May

Pros of Autumn in Mendoza

Ask any wine aficionado and they’ll tell you that autumn is the best time to visit Mendoza!

Harvest season, locally known as the Vendimia, kicks off with a bang in March. The National Grape Harvest Festival, known as Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia, is celebrated with beauty pageants, traditional dances, folkloric musicians, elaborately decorated floats, a spectacular final show at the Frank Romero Day Amphitheatre, and the crowning of the Harvest Queen.

You’ll be clapping along with 20,000 other people as fireworks light up the Andes backdrop - truly bucket‑list stuff.

An autumn visit to Mendoza also brings the possibility of taking part in special harvest tours where you can actually stomp grapes with your feet (this is known as vino patero) and taste juice straight from the press!

Weather‑wise, afternoons hover in the mid‑20s °C (low‑70s °F). Warm days and cooler nights are ideal for exploring the vineyards, hiking without intense summer heat, or going on an Andes excursion to the High Mountains.

Meanwhile, the hillsides morph into a patchwork of reds, oranges, and golds making the vineyard landscapes especially picturesque. 

Autumn is my favourite time of year to visit Mendoza - I love the milder weather and changing foliage, but there's still enough on the schedule!

Cons of Autumn in Mendoza

What's the downside of autumn in Mendoza? With Vendimia in full swing, accommodation sells out months in advance, and traffic around the event venues can snarl. Because this is a popular time to visit Mendoza, you'll want to book your hotel and arrange your tours well in advance.

By late April, the temperature dips and some wineries shorten opening hours meaning fewer options if you visit later in autumn.

Winter in Mendoza 

June, July and August

Pros of Winter in Mendoza

Winter in Mendoza is more about cozy malbec‑by‑the‑fireplace vibes than sun‑kissed vineyards, but don’t write it off!

One of the pros of visiting Mendoza in winter is that there are fewer tourists and you can often get discounted hotel rates. This means you can take your hotel budget and upgrade to a fancy wine hotel. There are deals to be had, so have a look at properties you normally wouldn't consider!

Snow blankets the high Andes turning it into a playground for winter sport enthusiasts. 

Las Leñas is a high-mountain ski resort located in the heart of the Andes Mountains. Its base sits at 2,240 metres above sea level while its summit is 3,430 metres high. It has 30 ski runs and a season that runs from June to September. That means you can carve fresh powder in the morning and sip barrel samples back in the valley by mid‑afternoon.

Perks include gloriously clear mountain views - winter brings the least haze!

Several wineries host intimate locro‑and‑Malbec lunches for Argentina’s Independence Day on July 9th - great if you’re keen on traditional comfort food.

Cons of Winter in Mendoza

The downside is that the vineyards won't be looking their most beautiful as all the vines will be bare. A handful of boutique producers also shut their doors for annual maintenance, and shorter daylight hours can limit your daily mileage if you’re road‑tripping.

Crisp daytime temps of 12–15 °C (mid‑50s °F) give way to chilly nights that hover around freezing. While Mendoza’s winters are relatively mild compared to other parts of the country (I'm looking at you Patagonia!), it can still get chilly, especially at night and in the mountains.

Dress warm, rent a car with good heating, and enjoy getting the region almost to yourself.

So, when is the Best Time to Visit Mendoza?

Ultimately, Mendoza’s wineries and the scenic Andes backdrop ensure an unforgettable visit any time of year, but knowing what each season offers will help you plan the perfect escape.

If vibrant festivals, harvest activities, and lively crowds excite you, aim for late summer or early autumn.

If you prefer a tranquil getaway with mild weather and fewer tourists, consider spring or winter.

If warm weather, green vineyards, and outdoor adventure top your list, summer is your season.

That means the best time to visit Mendoza is entirely up to your wants and what you're hoping to experience during your trip! Just pick your vibe and don’t forget to raise a glass to the Andes while you’re there.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,08301644f19721ae5be55ec2f4964f7c9911edbf

Reaching the City at the End of the World is quite the endeavour, so if you're going to go through all the effort of getting there, you probably want to choose the best time to visit.

The great thing about Ushuaia is that it's a versatile destination that offers unique tours and adventures throughout the year. 

Summer is great for cruising the Beagle Channel and spotting sea lions, autumn brings fiery landscapes that charm hikers, winter is the time to hit the slopes at Cerro Castor, and spring brings Tierra del Fuego National Park to life again with wildflowers and active wildlife.

Like most travellers to Ushuaia, I chose to visit during the summer months in order to make the most of the long days and good weather. I also wanted to ring in the New Year in the southernmost city in the world, but that proved to be a bit anticlimactic as there isn't a whole lot going on unless you want to go to a bar! 

That's why today I'm breaking down the pros and cons of visiting Ushuaia in each season, along with activities and events you may want to include in your plans!

Best Time to Visit Ushuaia, Argentina

Summer in Ushuaia

(December to February)

Pros of summer in Ushuaia

Summer is the most popular time of year to visit Ushuaia with tourists descending on the city at the End of the World by the thousands. 

The pros of visiting Ushuaia in the summer are the long days where you can enjoy up to 18 hours of daylight! We found it a bit strange not experiencing darkness; we went to sleep before sunset and woke up long after sunrise. But on the bright side - quite literally! - it means you can maximize your days and squeeze in different tours and excursions.

Weatherwise, the summer temperatures in Ushuaia range from 8–20°C (46–68°F), making it a really nice time to enjoy outdoor activities.

We did quite a bit of hiking in Tierra del Fuego National Park during our summer visit. One of our highlights was hiking the Senda Costera or Coastal Trail, which starts next to the Post Office at the End of the World (where you can send a postcard!) and then follows the shores of the Beagle Channel.

There are lots of different tours you can enjoy inside Tierra del Fuego National Park, so don't think you're just limited to hiking. There's also canoeing, birdwatching, and the famous End of the World train ride.

Plus, there are numerous hikes to enjoy in and around Ushuaia, like Laguna Esmeralda and Vinciguerra Glacier, just to name a couple.

Another activity we thoroughly enjoyed was going on a Beagle Channel boat tour where we got to see sea lions, sea birds and Magellanic penguins! We also cruised past Les Éclaireurs Lighthouse, which is another iconic photo op.

If your schedule is flexible, summer is generally considered the best time to visit Ushuaia.

Summer is the peak season for cruises to Antarctica, so if you're planning to combine your visit to Ushuaia with a cruise to the White Continent, then summer is the best time to do so. If that's the case and you only have a few days to enjoy the city, you may find this 3-day Ushuaia travel itinerary helpful.

Cons of summer in Ushuaia

The downside of visiting Ushuaia in the summertime is that it is peak tourist season. This means it's important you book your accommodations and tours in advance as certain experiences can sell out.

If you want to stay at a particular property - Ushuaia has some beautiful luxury hotels! - you'll want to reserve that in advance. The same goes for the boat tours that visit Isla Martillo to walk with penguins, as only a small number of visitors are permitted per day.

The higher demand for tours and accommodations can also result in slightly higher prices than in the shoulder season, however, we still found it to be reasonably priced for such a remote corner of the world.

Lastly, I think it's worth noting that even during the summer months, the weather in Ushuaia can be quite temperamental, as it is across Patagonia. We visited during December and January and experienced everything from sunshine to intense winds and freezing rain. You still need to pack for a sub-Antarctic climate!

Recommended Summer Activity in Ushuaia:🐧 Hop aboard a Beagle Channel cruise with mini trekking. You'll see penguins and sea lions and cruise past the famous Les Éclaireurs Lighthouse. You'll then disembark at Bridges Islands for a walk and talk about local wildlife and the Yámana people.

Autumn in Ushuaia

(March to May)

Pros of Autumn in Ushuaia

Autumn in Ushuaia brings vibrant colours as the forests turn all shades of crimson, pumpkin and gold. This is the time of year that draws photographers looking to capture the changing Fuegian landscapes.

The weather starts to cool down ranging from 5–10°C (41–50°F), however, it's still a very comfortable temperature for hiking and enjoying the outdoors.

Some hikes to consider for peeping autumn colours include Laguna Esmeralda, Martial Glacier, and many of the trails in Tierra del Fuego National Park, which remain accessible through mid-autumn until the snow arrives.

Alternatively, you can admire the autumn foliage on a helicopter flight over Ushuaia, or you can also take in the landscapes while cruising the waters of the Beagle Channel.

Another pro of visiting Ushuaia in autumn is that it's the shoulder season. This means it is quieter with fewer tourists and you can expect to see prices drop for accommodations and tours.

Cons of Autumn in Ushuaia

There aren't too many downsides to visiting Ushuaia in autumn. Sudden rain and cooler spells can occur, but you can always save these days for indoor activities like visiting the Old Ushuaia Prison, going on a double-decker bus tour, or enjoying a taste of Fuegian cuisine. 

Recommended autumn activity in Ushuaia:🍂 Join a 4x4 tour of Paso Garibaldi, a mountain pass across the Fuegian Andes where you'll enjoy the autumn foliage. You'll see Lake Escondido, Lake Fagnano, and finish the excursion with a traditional Argentine barbecue.

Winter in Ushuaia 

(June to August)

Pros of Winter in Ushuaia

Winter in Ushuaia is something straight out of a postcard. This is when the City at the End of the World transforms into a wintry wonderland with snow-covered mountains and forests.

During this time of year, you can enjoy an abundance of outdoor sports like snowshoeing, dog sledding, snowmobiling, and ice trekking. This is the best time to go to Ushuaia for all things related to outdoor winter fun! 

Ushuaia is home to Cerro Castor, Argentina's southernmost ski resort, offering downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, snowboarding, and even an ice skating rink.

There are two fun winter events at Cerro Castor: the Snow Pool where skiers and snowboarders slide down a slope and then attempt to glide over a pool of water, and the Torch Descent where skiers and snowboarders descend the mountain with torches putting on a show for spectators.

Finally, we can't forget about Fiesta Nacional de La Noche Más Larga, or The Longest Night Festival, which celebrates the winter solstice with live music, dancing, and a variety of activities that take place across the city.

Cons of Winter in Ushuaia

The downside of winter in Ushuaia is that it will be cold. However, if you're visiting from Canada or the Nordic countries, you won't actually find it that cold! You might even say it's a mild winter.

The temperatures hover around -2 to 5°C (28–41°F), though it can feel colder with the wind chill and Ushuaia does experience strong winds.

Another downside of winter travel in Ushuaia is that certain hiking trails in Tierra del Fuego National Park and the surrounding area will be closed due to ice and snow. However, you can enjoy some of the landscapes in the park by riding the Train at the End of the World, also known as the Southern Fuegian Railway.

The days will be a lot shorter with around 6-8 daylight hours, depending on the month you visit.

Recommended Winter Activity in Ushuaia: 🚂 Ride the End of the World Train and enjoy the snowy landscape while you learn about Ushuaia's origins as a penal colony.

Spring in Ushuaia

(September to November)

Pros of Spring in Ushuaia

The springtime weather is still relatively cool with daytime temperatures ranging from 5–12°C (41–54°F).

If you visit in early spring, you might still be able to enjoy a bit of skiing or snowboarding on Cerro Castor!

As springtime arrives in Ushuaia, the snow melts, the trails in Tierra del Fuego National Park become more accessible and wildlife becomes more active. That means plenty of opportunities to spot sea birds, penguins, and seals!

Because spring is shoulder season, that means there are fewer tourists around, which also translates to better prices on both accommodations and tours.

Cons of spring in Ushuaia

One of the cons of spring travel in Ushuaia is that the weather can be a bit unpredictable bringing a mixture of sudden rain, strong winds and even lingering snow. 

This means you have to be flexible with your plans and you should save a few indoor activities for inclement weather days. One of the lessons we learned during our trip to Ushuaia was that not every day will be a hiking day!

Another thing to consider is that during the early spring season, some trails may still be muddy or partially closed.

Recommended Spring Activity in Ushuaia:🌷Go on a small group guided hike to Laguna Esmeralda known for its green-turquoise colour. This tour includes a complimentary boxed lunch.

So, when should you visit Ushuaia?

As you can see, the best time to visit Ushuaia greatly depends on the types of activities you want to enjoy and each season brings its own pros and cons.

Summer is for hiking, seeing penguins, and embarking on Antarctic expeditions. Winter is all about snow sports and some unique events. Meanwhile, spring and autumn bring fewer tourists, lower prices and stunning landscapes.

One thing is for certain, there is no shortage of options whatever season you choose!

So, if you're ready to start planning your trip, here's some information on different ways to get to Ushuaia, and here's a complete travel guide to the southernmost city so you can get some ideas of things to do once you get here.",CheArgentinaTravel.com,1109095c7d72e429d6d07ac64343dde0a97a490c

Argentina's second-largest city may still be relatively undiscovered by international tourists, but it's a destination with a lot to offer.

In Cordoba, you can explore the Jesuit Quarter which is sprinkled with cathedrals, churches, crypts and other historic buildings from the city's early days.

You can browse the artisanal fair at Paseo de las Artes or shop at the ornate mall known as Patio Olmos. Mornings can be spent wandering through museums and art galleries and afternoons strolling the gardens of Parque Sarmiento. The options really are endless!

But let's get back to where to stay in Cordoba because each neighbourhood has its own distinct flair. In this guide, we're going to highlight 3 different neighbourhoods in Cordoba that are ideal for travellers - that means walking distance to the main attractions and plenty of options for dining and shopping.

Plus, we'll also share some of our top picks for boutique hotels, mid-range hotels, and hostels in the city.

Where to Stay in Cordoba

Being centrally located and able to reach the city's main attractions on foot is an important thing to consider when booking your accommodations. If you only have a few days in the city, you don't want to be in a quiet residential area that doesn't have much to offer tourists or have to put up with a long commute into the city centre.

That's why we're going to highlight three neighbourhoods that are ideal for travellers, and each of these offers something a little different ranging from historic areas with colonial architecture, lively boroughs with plenty of nightlife, and neighbourhoods that offer art and culture but are also close to green spaces.

Centro

Best neighbourhood for history and culture

If you want to live and breathe Cordoba's colonial history, stay in Centro which is the Old Town. This part of the city is home to the Jesuit Quarter or Jesuit Block, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is where the city saw its early beginnings and walking through these streets will transport you back through time. In Centro, you'll find attractions like Cordoba Cathedral, the Jesuit Crypt, the Society of Jesus Church, and the National University of Cordoba (the oldest university in Argentina and the third oldest in the Americas).

Nueva Córdoba

Best neighbourhood for art, culture and greenery

Nueva Córdoba is considered a student neighbourhood so it has a very youthful atmosphere. It is home to a couple of universities and its numerous faculties. Here you'll find bars, cafés, and cultural venues. Some of the top attractions in Nueva Cordoba include Paseo del Buen Pastor, the Church of the Capuchins, the Fine Art Museum, the Latin American Craft Museum, and the Anthropology Museum. The neighbourhood is also right next to Parque Sarmiento offering a nearby green escape.

Güemes

Best neighbourhood for nightlife and dining

Güemes is another neighbourhood to consider if you prefer a lively atmosphere. This is Cordoba's trendiest neighbourhood known for its bohemian vibe, walls covered in street art, and pulsating nightlife. Here you'll find restaurants, bars and nightclubs that stay open late. There are plenty of boutique shops to browse during the daytime, plus you can walk along the tree-lined stream known as La Cañada and browse the handicrafts in Paseo de las Artes. Güemes is a nice place to explore, but if sleep is your priority, keep in mind that you may hear music and conversation until the early hours of the morning, especially if you end up in a street-facing hotel room.

Remember that Córdoba is a relatively compact city, so you can easily explore multiple neighbourhoods during your visit. Each neighbourhood has its own unique charm and attractions, so be sure to choose the one that aligns with your interests and preferences.

Boutique Hotels in Cordoba

 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Azur Real Hotel Boutique & Spa (@azurhotel) 

Azur Real Hotel Boutique

Azur Real is a family-run boutique hotel set in the heart of Cordoba's Centro neighbourhood. The building dates back to 1915 and is steeped in history; over the years, it has been a leather workshop, a pharmacy, a school, a Chinese restaurant and a dance club, just to name a few of its roles.

By the time this building was acquired by its current owners, it sat in ruins and was painstakingly renovated over the course of four years. The result is a warm and homey atmosphere that showcases Cordoba's architectural history.

The hotel's key selling feature is its spa called Baños de Azur, where you can enjoy their Ancient Baths Circuit. This is a 2-hour tour by candlelight through 12 different areas where water in its different states and temperatures promotes a state of relaxation.

The rooms have a contemporary-meets-rustic feel and range from standard to more luxurious suites with a private patio, large dressing room and jacuzzi.

Azur Real Hotel Boutique has an onsite restaurant called Bruma, which uses fresh, organic and locally sourced ingredients. Itacú is their tea house featuring artisan teas, native mountain herbs and yerba mate.

San Antonio de Areco is a sleepy town in the pampas and it's a popular weekend destination from Buenos Aires. A big part of the experience is immersing yourself in gaucho culture and rural living and that involves visiting or staying at an estancia!

Estancias are traditional ranches or farms primarily used for rearing cattle and growing crops and you can find them all over Argentina. 

The estancias in San Antonio de Areco range from high-end properties that offer full room and board plus numerous activities to smaller estancias closer to town at a more accessible price range.

Estancias in San Antonio de Areco

There are so many estancias across Buenos Aires Province and many of them are located in and around the town of San Antonio de Areco! These range from luxury estancias to smaller family-run establishments with a more rugged feel. Here's a selection of places for you to consider:

1. Estancia La Cinacina

We were pretty set on staying at an estancia since that is part of the experience of coming to the self-proclaimed gaucho capital. During my search, I stumbled upon Estancia La Cinacina which dates back to 1870.

The beauty of this estancia is that it is located in the west end of town, yet it's only 6 blocks away from the main square, Plaza Ruiz De Arellano. Almost all of the other estancias in San Antonio de Areco are located on the outskirts of town and require a car, however, this property allowed us to explore on foot for the length of our stay.

Breakfast at the estancia was abundant and we really enjoyed it. It featured two baskets of baked goods (one filled with medialunas or sweet croissants), jams, cereal, yogurt, freshly squeezed orange juice, tea, coffee, and an abundance of fresh fruit like watermelon, plums, grapes and apples.

The estancia has a huge pool which is open during the summer months, and they also offer horseback riding and massages for an additional fee.

If you're looking for an estancia experience close to town that won't break the bank, this is a nice mid-range option. We found the staff to be friendly and attentive, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

So you're planning a trip to Patagonia, you know you want to join a group excursion, and now you're trying to decide which G Adventures Patagonia tour is right for you.

G Adventures offers numerous trips across Patagonia, some of which strictly focus on travel in Argentine Patagonia and others that also include Chilean Patagonia.

Today, we're going to be comparing 3 different G Adventures tours to Patagonia that vary in length, destinations covered, and level of difficulty. 

What do I know about Patagonia? Well, I've travelled extensively across both Argentine Patagonia and Chilean Patagonia, and I have visited all of the destinations covered in these G Adventures Patagonia tours. I know these destinations very well, how much time you need in each place, and what activities and attractions you shouldn't miss in each spot.

I would go as far as saying I'm a bit travel-obsessed with Patagonia. I got hooked on my first visit back in 2019 and I've been going back every chance I get. Basically, whenever I'm in Argentina (which is often!), I always make sure to plan a trip back to Patagonia! 

But enough about me, because this article is about helping you figure out your trip to Patagonia. 

So with all of this in mind, we're going to do a deep dive into 3 different Patagonia tours offered by G Adventures, so hopefully, by the end of this article, you'll know which one is right for you!

Which G Adventures Patagonia tour is right for YOU?

Now that we've looked at all of these G Adventures Patagonia tours, it's time to figure out which one is right for you, so let's quickly review each one:

The End of the Earth Tour is the classic Patagonia trip that hits all the highlights. It does move at a quicker pace averaging 1-2 nights per destination, but you cover a lot of ground and even make it to Ushuaia. You get to enjoy multiple hikes (even some challenging ones!), but you're not hiking every single day of the trip. You also get 2 nights of camping in a national park. If you're an active traveller who wants to cover a lot of ground fast, this might be the tour for you!

The Hike Patagonia in Depth Tour is all about hiking. You spend lots of time in Los Glaciares National Park and Torres del Paine National Park and you get to hike every single day! You even get to camp for 4 nights while hiking the famous W Trek. This is probably the most physically demanding tour, but you are going to spend every single day in the mountains amazed at the views. If you're an avid hiker who enjoys fitness, this could be your tour!

The Patagonia Hiking Tour is short but sweet. You only visit Argentina but you get ample time in El Calafate and El Chaltén. You're not switching hotels every night of the trip, which means you get to explore each town in depth at a more relaxed pace. If you're short on time but want to see the best of Argentine Patagonia, this is the tour for you!

Hopefully, after an in-depth look at each of these 3 G Adventures Patagonia tours, you've been able to narrow it down. 

There's nothing left to do now but pack your bags and head on down to Patagonia. Wishing you a great trip and happy trails!

1b900f61d2ebc4fe349ddebb7f1fdd072b06199a,che_argentina_travel,en,Why This El Calafate Glacier Boat Tour is Worth the Splurge!,"Going on an El Calafate glacier boat tour was one of the highlights of our trip to Patagonia! This is our experience of the Gourmet Glaciers tour aboard Maria Turquesa.

If you only make time for one excursion in El Calafate, I would make it the boat tour to the glaciers aboard Maria Turquesa with MarPatag. This was the highlight of my trip to El Calafate and I haven't stopped raving about it to anyone who will listen!

So what was so amazing about this glaciers boat tour, you ask?

Well, for starters the number of icebergs and glaciers we got to see and how close we got to them!

Los Glaciares National Park forms part of the South Patagonian Ice Field which stretches across Argentina and Chile. It is the largest ice field in South America and it feeds numerous glaciers! 

When you visit Los Glaciares National Park from El Calafate you come face to face with the most famous glacier of them all, Perito Moreno. However, there are many other glaciers to see within the park - many of them far larger and grander - but most travellers don't know about these since they can only be reached by boat!

There were so many highlights during our glaciers boat tour aboard Maria Turquesa: cruising the milky turquoise waters of Lago Argentino, feeling the icy sub-Antarctic breeze blowing in our faces, fishing chunks of iceberg for our beverages, seeing waterfalls formed by meltwater cascading down the mountains and so much more!

I've visited some truly majestic places across Patagonia, but the experience of seeing these glaciers up close was the one that moved me to tears. I loved this tour and at the end of the day, my husband and I looked at each other and agreed that we'd be willing to get back on the same tour and do it all over again the next day.

So without further ado, here's a recap of our experience on this El Calafate glaciers boat tour, so you know exactly what to expect.

🛥️ Maria Turquesa Full Day Sightseeing Glaciers Cruise - This is the El Calafate boat tour to the glaciers that we booked. This is a full-day tour (approximately 9 hours) and it includes a packed gourmet lunchbox.

Transfer to Puerto Soledad

First things first, we had to make our way to the port!

This El Calafate glacier tour started with a 48-kilometre drive out to Punta Bandera / Puerto Soledad which is a private port on the southern shores of Lago Argentino just west of El Calafate.

You can book this tour with transfers or without transfers. We opted for the transfer which included pickup and drop off at our lodgings in El Calafate. Pickups start at 07:15 am so you'll want to be up bright and early. 

Alternatively, if you're planning to rent a car in El Calafate or if you're staying outside the urban pickup areas in town, you can make your own way to the port.

Los Glaciares National Park Entrance Fee

Before boarding our vessel, Maria Turquesa, we had to pay the admission fee to Los Glaciares National Park since the whole cruise takes place in the park. 

There was a small booth where we all lined up to pay the fee. You can view current admission rates here since these vary for international visitors, national visitors and provincial visitors.

I'll also mention that even though they accept debit and credit card payments, it's a good idea to have some Argentine pesos on you to pay this fee since the internet does tend to cut in and out in these remote places. Sometimes you have to attempt a payment multiple times and other times it just doesn't go through!

Tip: If you're planning to visit Los Glaciares National Park on two consecutive days, you can save 50% off your second visit. We paid for this pass since we knew we wanted to come back to visit Perito Moreno Glacier and explore the balconies and boardwalks.

El Calafate Glacier Boat Tour

So, now I'm going to give you a play-by-play of our day on the Gourmet Glaciers tour so you know exactly what to expect, should you decide to do it!

After paying our admission fee to Los Glaciares National Park, we boarded the vessel at 8:30 am and set sail by 9:00 am.

As we were leaving port, we decided to get some hot beverages. We each ordered a vanilla cappuccino with a medialuna. 

Once we left port and were out cruising Lago Argentino, we were able to go out on the deck and it wasn't long before we spotted our first iceberg.

In fact, the day was full of icebergs and glaciers!

Seco Glacier

The first glacier we visited on our glaciers boat cruise was Seco Glacier, which translates to 'dry glacier'. This is a hanging glacier and its name refers to the fact that it is currently receding.

Unlike other glaciers in the park that flow directly into the lake, Seco Glacier ends on a rocky outcrop without reaching the water. This gives it a somewhat barren and stark appearance, contrasting sharply with the lush surroundings.

Heim Glacier

We continued towards Heim Glacier, which is a hanging glacier that had these incredible meltwater cascades running down the side of the mountain.

Spegazzini Glacier

Next on the itinerary was Spegazzini Glacier, named after Carlos Luis Spegazzini, the Italian-Argentine botanist who was the first to study the local flora.

The main characteristic of this glacier is its height which reaches 135 meters along its front. This makes it the highest glacier in Los Glaciares National Park and one of the most important!

Due to the glacier's steep and high front wall, you can often witness spectacular calving events, where massive chunks of ice break off and crash into the lake, sending waves rippling across the water.

Puesto de las Vacas

Halfway through the cruise, we disembarked at a place called Puesto de las Vacas, which literally translates to 'cow stall'.

This is a remote part of Los Glaciares National Park, where a Finnish-Chilean couple lived and whose job it was to capture the wild cows that escaped from the nearby estancias and bring them back into town!

For this part of the excursion, we were split into smaller Spanish and English-speaking groups and we went on a guided hike.

It was nice to stretch our legs before getting back on the boat for more glaciers!

Upsala Glacier

That afternoon we also visited the Upsala Glacier and Bertacchi Glacier.

Upsala Glacier is a valley glacier, currently in a state of recession, that sits on the eastern side of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. 

It is named after Uppsala University in Sweden since they sponsored the first glaciological studies conducted in this area.

Bertacchi Glacier

Bertacchi Glacier is one of three lesser eastflowing tributaries of Upsala Glacier together with Cono Glacier and Murallón Glacier. 

However, Upsala Glacier has retreated to such a degree that it no longer constrains Bertacchi Glacier.

The Gourmet Glaciers Lunchbox

We then took a pause from all the glacier-spotting to have lunch. 

The name of this particular tour is Gourmet Glaciers, and you can choose between a gourmet tasting menu served on the private deck, or a fancy lunchbox, which is what we opted for.

We were served a Patagonian lamb sandwich with caramelized onions and cheese, a side of roasted carrot and potato wedges and one non-alcoholic beverage per person. For a packed lunchbox, it was a really nice meal!

Because this tour was a special occasion, we also decided to order a bottle of wine - Malbec, of course! - to toast to such a wonderful day. 

At one point during the boat tour, the guides fished a piece of iceberg from the lake, so guests had the option to sip whiskey with glacial ice. It was a pleasant surprise when the servers came around with chunks of the iceberg for anyone who wanted to add it to their drinks - we did!

Then for dessert, we got a brownie and dulce de leche mousse with blueberries. We weren't even expecting dessert, so this was a pleasant surprise.

Canal de los Témpanos

All through lunch, we continued our El Calafate glacier boat tour towards Canal de los Témpanos, which translates to 'iceberg channel'.

The channel is named so since this is where the ice that breaks off Perito Moreno Glacier ends up.

Because we ended up revisiting Los Glaciares National Park the day after this glacier boat tour, we had the opportunity to see this place up close.

There is a very short and easy hike to Mirador Canal de los Témpanos via a boardwalk, where you can stand on the shores of Lake Argentino and watch the icebergs bob in the water.

Perito Moreno Glacier

Then it was time for the main attraction: Perito Moreno Glacier! 

This particular glacier is the icon of Los Glaciares National Park. It’s the reason why people travel all the way to Patagonia...to see this one glacier!

What is so special about the Perito Moreno Glacier?

Well, for starters, it’s one of the few glaciers in the world that is still growing.

It’s also pretty massive! The glacier’s front is 5 kilometres long, its height above the water is 60 meters, and its total depth is about 170 meters - so you're actually only seeing a small part of what it is.

Sometimes you can build up an attraction in your head and then it's a bit underwhelming, but this was far from the case with Perito Moreno Glacier. If anything, I would say the experience was overwhelming!

Seeing that wall of blue ice, feeling the glacial air blowing in my face, and watching as chunks of ice calved into the water was nothing short of spectacular. 

There are so many Perito Moreno Glacier boat tours and sometimes choosing one can feel a bit overwhelming, but I was very happy with our decision. 

All in all, it was an amazing day and an experience I hope to repeat again the next time I visit El Calafate, hopefully bringing my parents and in-laws along!

How to book the Gourmet Glaciers Tour

So, how do you book this El Calafate glaciers boat tour aboard Maria Turquesa?

Good question! There are a few different ways. 

Viator: The Gourmet Glaciers boat tour is listed on Viator. This is the easiest and most straightforward way of booking this tour, especially for foreigners. It also means you can book your tour well in advance, which is a good idea if you're visiting during the high season (December-March) when the tour can sell out days in advance. The downside is that the tour does cost a bit more when you book through Viator.

Tour operator: MarPatag Cruceros is the tour operator for the Gourmet Glaciers cruise aboard Maria Turquesa. Their rates are listed here in ARS. Booking things in Argentina isn't always very straightforward, so if you want to book directly with MarPatag Cruceros you'll either need to send a message through their contact form and wait for a response or get in touch via Whatsapp. It's a bit more work, but you can get the tour for a bit cheaper.

In person: Booking in person is always a bit of a gamble in terms of availability if you're visiting El Calafate during the high season. This is because tours like this one can book up. If you only have a few days in town, you probably don't want to risk it! However, if you're staying in El Calafate for a while, you can try to book something as soon as you arrive for a later date. This involves a bit more legwork, but most of the tour agencies are located along Avenida del Libertador, so it's just a matter of going in, asking prices and comparing.

Our experience on the Gourmet Glaciers Cruise

It can be hard to put this experience into words, so I think it's best I show you. I think this video captures the magic of our El Calafate glacier boat tour and why we loved it so much. Enjoy!

About Me

I'm Audrey Bergner and I'm the Founder and Head Travel Writer at Che Argentina Travel. I'm a Canadian-born Argentine-Peruvian travel writer.

Argentina has been part of my story since childhood. I grew up here, spending my early years in the Sierras de Córdoba climbing trees, picking blackberries, and swimming in creeks.

As a young adult, I backpacked across the length of the country multiple times travelling by long-distance buses, veering off the beaten path, and learning how Argentina truly works for independent travellers.

This experience taught me to navigate the complex economic reality of Argentina—from mastering the 'Blue Dollar' exchange rates to understanding local inflation strategies. My advice isn't just about where to go; it's about how to make your budget work in a country with a uniquely challenging financial landscape.

Now, I explore Argentina differently, travelling with my husband, Samuel, and our daughter, Aurelia. Our trips often revolve around estancia stays in the countryside, hiking in national parks, exploring small towns and seeking out great food and good wine. 

Navigating the dust and complex logistics of restoring our three-generation family property in the Sierras de Córdoba. (The ""Alfajores & Medialunas"" shirt is a non-negotiable uniform for Argentine site visits.)

When I'm not travelling, I am working on renovating a property in Argentina with a hotel that has been in the family for three generations.

This restoration is more than a passion project; it is a deep dive into the Argentine hospitality industry. By managing a historic property, I navigate the same local bureaucracy, logistics, and supply chains that I write about, ensuring my travel advice is grounded in the true grit and reality of daily life here.

Our family currently splits time between the Sierras of Cordoba in Argentina and the Rocky Mountains in Canada, where mountain life feels surprisingly familiar to Patagonia.

Welcome. My approach to travel is shaped by my Argentine-Peruvian heritage and a deep desire to connect you with the authentic soul of the country—far beyond the standard tourist trail. (Embracing tradition in San Antonio de Areco.)

Why Che Argentina Travel?

I created Che Argentina Travel to help you, fellow traveller, plan your dream trip to Argentina! I am passionate about travel in Argentina and want to help you discover every corner of this wonderfully diverse country. 

Whether it's your first time here or you're back for more, I hope to help you uncover new destinations and experiences. The goal is to help you experience Argentina beyond the surface with honest guidance built from years of personal exploration.

This site is here to help you plan realistic itineraries, understand logistics before you arrive, discover places beyond the obvious highlights, travel confidently and responsibly, and fall in love with Argentina the way I have.

Che Argentina Travel covers all regions in Argentina: Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Litoral, Cuyo, Northwest, and Patagonia. I am currently undertaking Project 23: a mission to document every single province in Argentina and explore every national park. That means new destinations are constantly being added to this website.

Project 23 is far more than a checklist; it’s a personal mission to explore every corner of this country I call home. My goal is to take you beyond the typical places and shine a light on the hidden magic found in all 23 provinces, creating a resource that celebrates the entirety of Argentina.

Every guide on Che Argentina Travel is built from real experience. I visit destinations personally before writing about them. I test accommodations, transport routes, restaurants, tours, and hikes whenever possible. I verify information with official providers when firsthand testing isn’t possible. I update content as conditions change. And I clearly distinguish between personal experience and researched information.

As for the name, 'che' is an Argentine expression that makes its way into almost every conversation. It could be used to grab someone's attention, to emphasize something, or even as a filler.

From the emerging wine regions of Patagonia to global destinations, our work spans across the entire Samuel & Audrey Media Network. This shot captures a moment of blissful wine tourism research in Trevelin, Chubut.

Where else can you find us?

Before I started writing about Argentina, I spent over a decade backpacking the globe and visited 75+ countries. That adventure is chronicled on That Backpacker.

If you enjoy travel and spend any time on YouTube, it's likely you've watched one of the thousands of videos Samuel and I have filmed over the years. We run two channels: Samuel and Audrey (English) and Samuel y Audrey (Spanish), where we publish practical travel guides and share travel advice after more than a decade on the road.

As for Samuel, you can find him writing about our travels on Nomadic Samuel and disrupting the investing world with his unique ideas at Picture Perfect Portfolios. 

Participating in local traditions is a core part of my research. Whether it’s trying my hand at fly fishing at Estancia Tecka or navigating remote Patagonian trails, I personally test the experiences I recommend to ensure your logistics are seamless.
